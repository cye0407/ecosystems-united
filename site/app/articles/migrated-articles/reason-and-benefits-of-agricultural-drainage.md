# reasons for and benefits of agricultural drainage

Agricultural drainage plays a crucial role in optimizing land productivity and soil health. It serves two primary purposes: removing excess surface and subsurface water and preventing soil salinity by flushing out soluble salts. Effective drainage enhances crop growth, improves soil conditions, and supports long-term sustainability in farming practices.

## **Types of Agricultural Drainage Systems**

There are two main types of **drainage systems** used in agriculture:

#### **Surface Drainage System**

A surface drainage system removes excess water from the land’s surface, preventing waterlogging and soil erosion. It relies on land grading and constructed channels to redirect water efficiently.

#### **Subsurface Drainage System**

A subsurface drainage system regulates the water table within the soil to prevent root zone saturation. This system consists of either:

- **Open drains** – Exposed ditches that lower the water table.

- **Pipe drains** – Buried pipes that efficiently remove excess water from deeper soil layers.

Both types of drainage systems help direct excess water into a **collector drain**, ensuring optimal soil conditions and preventing ponding.

Both types of drainage are employed to direct excess surface water to a collector drain in order to prevent ponding.

### **Key Components of a Drainage System**

A well-designed agricultural drainage system consists of three main components:

#### **1. Field Drainage System**

- Controls the water table and prevents ponding.

- Uses a network of field drains to gather excess water.

- Supplemental measures may be employed to improve drainage efficiency.

#### **2. Main Drainage System**

- Transports collected water from the **field drainage system** to an **outlet point**.

- Utilizes a **canalized stream** (a modified natural stream) to improve flow efficiency.

#### **3. Outlet System**

- Discharges excess drainage water into a **lake, river, or sea**.

- May rely on **gravity-powered drainage** or require **pumping stations** to transport water if the drainage system is lower than the receiving body of water.

## Benefits of Agricultural Drainage

There are several benefits of agricultural drainage.  The biggest and most important improved aeration within soils which results in better yields. This is due to the fact that:

- **Deeper crop rooting** – Enhancing plant stability and nutrient absorption.

- **Greater crop variety** – Expanding the types of crops that can be planted.

- **Fewer weeds** – Reducing competition for soil nutrients and water. 

- **Improved fertilizer efficiency** – Maximizing nutrient uptake and reducing runoff.

- **Reduced denitrification** – Lowering nitrogen loss and minimizing environmental impact.

- **Healthier grass swards** – Supporting stronger root systems in pastureland.

There are also additional benefits not related to aeration. They include:

- **Easier land access** – Preventing machinery from sinking into waterlogged fields. 

- **Higher soil bearing capacity** – Allowing for better farm infrastructure support. 

- **Improved soil tilth & workability** – Facilitating better seedbed preparation. 

- **Extended tillage period** – Allowing farmers to carry out operations over a longer season.

- **Enhanced micro-fauna habitat** – Encouraging earthworms and beneficial organisms that improve soil permeability.

- **Increased soil temperature** – Enabling earlier planting and faster germination.

Drainage also makes it possible to inhibit soil salinity.  Soil salinity levels indicate the amount of salt present in the soil. If there is too much salt, plant growth will be retarded.  To remove the excess salts from the soil, leaching is encouraged.  Leaching is the process of nutrients or salts being removed from the soil with water.  Leaching can occur naturally or as a result of irrigation and drainage systems. Sometimes leaching is necessary to repair land that has been negatively impacted by agricultural activities. It is also used to protect the root zone from being salinized by the capillary rise of saline water. Such safeguards allow for a wider variety of crops to be grown
