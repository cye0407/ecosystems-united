# how to measure the efficacy of intercropping

Although there are range of motivations for choosing to intercrop  in a farming system, strong production and output are undoubtedly main priorities. Accordingly, a means to measure the efficacy is necessary. This allows a farmer to objectively evaluate the outcome of their cropping plan and adjust their practices, e.g. spacing and cultivar use, accordingly. 

 The** land equivalent ratio** [LER], is the most common approach. LER is a helpful tool for measuring the max production criterion, the least area criterion, crop combination comparisons, and the agronomic practice comparison. 

 The **income equivalence ratio** [IER] uses a similar approach, but it measures yield in terms of net income rather than plant productivity and will fluctuate according to crop prices. Accordingly, it may not be as accurate of a gauge for measuring productivity. 

 Using the LER, the **competitive ratio** [CR] can be determined in order to measure the competitiveness of the two [or more] crops planted by accounting for the sowing proportions. 

 Likewise, the **monetary advantage index** [MAI] provides an indication of the economic advantage of an intercropping system. 

 To incorporate the time component by accounting for the duration of crop growth into the evaluation process, the **area time equivalent ratio** [ATER] is used.
