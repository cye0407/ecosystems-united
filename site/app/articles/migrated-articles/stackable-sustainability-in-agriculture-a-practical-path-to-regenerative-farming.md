# stackable sustainabilty: a 5 stack pyramid approach to regenerative agriculture

> 
*This article introduces the conceptual framework of the Agricultural Sustainability Pyramid. For detailed implementation guidance, economic data, and practical resources, see our companion guide: "The Small Farm Economic Advantage: Implementing the Sustainability Pyramid."*

Implementing sustainability practices in modern farming can feel overwhelming and financially risky. The solution? A structured, progressive approach that builds layer by layer. "Stackable Sustainability" in agriculture provides a pyramid framework where each level builds upon the previous one, creating a pathway to comprehensive regenerative farming that delivers environmental and economic benefits at every stage of farm development.

## **The Agricultural Sustainability Pyramid: Stacking Sustainability from the Ground Up**

Rather than attempting a [complete system](https://ecosystemsunited.com/the-food-systems-approach/) overhaul, successful sustainable farms build their operations one manageable layer at a time. The pyramid approach provides both structure and flexibility, allowing farms to progress at their own pace while ensuring each step strengthens the foundation for the next.

## **Why a Stackable Pyramid Structure Works for Regenerative Agriculture**

The pyramid model offers several key advantages over conventional sustainability approaches:

- **Progressive Implementation**: Each level builds upon the previous, creating a logical sequence that minimizes risk and complexity

- **Economic Viability**: Each layer delivers tangible returns before moving to the next level

- **Accessible Entry Points**: Farms can start with practices that match their current resources and capacity

- **System Integration**: Practices at each level complement and enhance those below them

- **Resilience Building**: Each new layer increases the farm's ability to withstand environmental and market disruptions

## **The Five Stacks of the Agricultural Sustainability Pyramid**

### **Stack 1 - Soil Health & Regenerative Agriculture Practices: The Foundation**

***The foundation that everything else builds upon***.

Healthy soil forms the base of the pyramid because it's fundamental to all agricultural production. Soil health practices reduce input costs, increase drought tolerance, and provide the biological foundation for subsequent levels.

#### **Why is soil health & regenerative agricultural practices the foundation of stackable sustainability in agriculture?**

- Improves the farm's capacity to implement higher-level practices

- Delivers relatively quick economic returns through reduced input needs

- Enhances natural systems that support biodiversity

- Creates resilience that buffers against implementation challenges at higher levels

**Key System Relationships:** Healthy soil retains more water, cycles nutrients more effectively, and supports more diverse biological communities, all of which enhance the effectiveness of practices at higher levels of the pyramid.

### **Stack 2 - Biodiversity Integration: The Reinforcement Layer**

***Creating resilience and natural solutions***.

Biodiversity strengthens and diversifies the foundation established by soil health practices. By enhancing natural pest control, improving pollination, and creating multiple revenue streams, this level reinforces the entire farm system.

#### **Why is biodiversity the second level of stackable sustainability in agriculture?**

- Builds directly on soil health improvements

- Creates natural balances that reduce external input needs

- Establishes multiple supporting mechanisms for farm resilience

- Diversifies risk across multiple enterprises and biological systems

**Key System Relationships:** Biodiversity expands the farm's functional capacity, creating synergies between production areas and natural habitats that further enhance soil health while setting the stage for resource circularity.

### **Stack 3 - Resource Circularity & Sustainable Waste Management: The Efficiency Layer**

***Transform waste streams into value streams.***

With soil health and biodiversity established, farms can more effectively implement resource circularity - turning waste into valuable inputs that further strengthen the system.

#### **Why is resource circularity and sustainable waste management the third level of stackable sustainability in agriculture?**

- Leverages biological systems established in levels 1 and 2

- Creates more efficient resource flows throughout the farm

- Reduces external input dependencies

- Captures value that would otherwise be lost

**Key System Relationships:** Circular systems like composting and water recirculation complement soil health and biodiversity while reducing costs and environmental impacts, preparing the farm for greater energy independence.

### **Stack 4 - Farm Energy Efficiency & Renewable Generation: The Independence Layer**

***From cost center to potential revenue***.

Energy represents both a significant cost and an opportunity for farms. This level focuses on reducing energy dependencies while potentially creating new revenue through renewable generation.

#### **What makes farm energy efficiency and renewable energy generation the fourth level of stackable sustainability in agriculture?**

- Requires capital that may come from savings generated in lower levels

- Benefits from operational efficiencies established in previous layers

- Creates infrastructure for long-term resilience

- Opens possibilities for new market opportunities at the top level

**Key System Relationships:** Energy systems interact with all previous levels - from powering irrigation systems that support soil health to creating microclimates that enhance biodiversity to providing heat for composting operations.

- **NREL – Solar Energy for Agriculture** – [https://www.nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov)*Government research on renewables tailored to agriculture.*

### **Stack 5 - Sustainable Market Positioning & Certification Documentation: The Premium Layer**

***Monetizing your environmental benefits***.

At the top of the pyramid, farms can leverage all previous investments to access premium markets and sustainability incentives, maximizing the economic returns from their regenerative practices.

#### **Why is sustainable market positioning and certification the premium layer of stackable sustainability in agriculture?**

- Builds on measurable outcomes from all previous levels

- Requires documentation and verification systems

- Connects farm practices directly to consumer value

- Completes the economic case for comprehensive sustainability

**Key System Relationships:** Market positioning capitalizes on the tangible benefits created at every level of the pyramid, creating financial incentives that reinforce the entire system and fund ongoing improvements.

## **How the Pyramid of Stackable Sustainability in Agriculture Works: System Dynamics**

The power of the pyramid approach lies in the relationships between levels. Each practice doesn't exist in isolation but connects to and enhances others:

### **Vertical Integration (Between Levels)**

Practices at each level create conditions that make higher-level practices more effective and economical:

- Soil health reduces water needs, making water recirculation systems more efficient

- Biodiversity reduces pest pressure, decreasing the workload on composting systems

- Resource circularity reduces input costs, freeing capital for energy investments

- Energy independence reduces operating costs, increasing margins for premium products

### **Horizontal Integration (Within Levels)**

Practices within each level also complement each other:

- Cover crops enhance the benefits of reduced tillage

- Beneficial insect habitats complement crop diversity

- Composting enhances precision application efficiency

- Solar generation pairs with efficient equipment upgrades

This interconnected nature creates a sustainability multiplier effect, where the combined benefits exceed what any single practice could achieve alone.

## **Building Your Farm's Sustainability Pyramid**

Every farm's journey through the pyramid will look different, reflecting their unique context, resources, and goals. However, the general progression follows these principles:

**1. Start Where You Are**

Assess your current position within the pyramid:

- Which practices from each level have you already implemented?

- Where are your strongest foundations and biggest gaps?

- Which level offers the most immediate opportunity given your specific constraints?

**2. Respect the Foundation**

While you may implement some practices from various levels simultaneously, ensure you're building a strong foundation:

- Prioritize soil health if you're just beginning

- Address significant soil limitations before extensive biodiversity investments

- Establish functional biological systems before complex resource circularity

**3. Find Your Path**

The pyramid provides structure without rigidity:

- Some farms might emphasize certain levels based on their specific opportunities

- The sequence remains important, but the pace can vary dramatically

- Implementation within each level should match your specific context

**4. Build Capacity Systematically**

Each level creates new capacities that enable success at higher levels:

- Knowledge and management skills

- Biological system functionality

- Financial resources

- Physical infrastructure
