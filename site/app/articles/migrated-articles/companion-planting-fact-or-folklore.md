# companion planting: fact or folklore

In recent years [and for generations among indigenous populations], [companion planting](https://ecosystemsunited.com/2019/01/02/an-introduction-to-companion-planting/) has emerged as a common technique aimed at exploiting the benefits of the relationships between specific plants to naturally improve crop flavor, health, and vigor. 

More simply, [companion planting](https://ecosystemsunited.com/2019/03/05/the-difference-between-intercropping-and-companion-planting/) is a type of polyculture where[ two plant species are grown together ](https://ecosystemsunited.com/2017/01/24/an-introduction-to-intercropping/)because it is known or theorized that they synergistically improve each other’s growth. However, empirical evidence of the actual efficacy of such practices is sometimes lacking. *This helpful guide helps to discern between fact, folklore, and traditional practice. *
