# An Introduction to Intercropping

**Stack 4: Resilience** — *Design for volatility*

Intercropping is growing two or more crops together in the same field for the same growing period. It's one of the most practical ways to build operational resilience without expanding land.

## Why This Matters for Stack 4

Single-crop operations are vulnerable. One pest outbreak, one price collapse, one weather event—and your entire season is at risk.

Intercropping distributes that risk across multiple crops in the same space. It's diversification at the field level, not just the farm level.

## The Four Intercropping Patterns

**Strip intercropping:** Crops grown in independent rows within the same field. Easiest to mechanize.

**Row intercropping:** At least one crop planted in rows, others interspersed. Balances structure with flexibility.

**Mixed intercropping:** No specific arrangement. Maximum ecological interaction, harder to manage.

**Relay intercropping:** Second crop planted after first reaches reproductive stage but before harvest. Extends productive use of land.

## The Classic Example: Three Sisters

Native American farmers figured this out centuries ago. Maize, pole beans, and winter squash grown together:

- Maize provides structure for beans to climb and shades squash
- Beans fix nitrogen for the maize
- Squash provides ground cover, retaining moisture and suppressing weeds

Each component makes the others more productive. That's the principle.

## What Makes Intercropping Work

The crops must be complementary—different rooting depths, canopy structures, heights, and nutrient requirements. When done right, resources that one crop can't use get captured by another.

**Five requirements for success:**

1. Detailed planning with understanding of crop characteristics
2. Timely sowing
3. Adequate fertilizer at appropriate times
4. Weed and pest management strategy
5. Efficient harvesting (this is where many intercropping systems fail)

## Measuring Success: Land Equivalent Ratio (LER)

The standard metric for intercropping efficacy:

**(Intercrop 1 yield ÷ Pure stand yield 1) + (Intercrop 2 yield ÷ Pure stand yield 2)**

- LER > 1.0 = advantageous pairing (you're getting more from the land)
- LER < 1.0 = disadvantageous pairing (stick to monoculture)

Most successful intercropping systems achieve LERs of 1.2-1.5, meaning 20-50% more productive use of land.

## So What Does This Mean for You?

Intercropping is a Stack 4 practice—it builds resilience through diversification. But it requires:

- **Stack 1 (Metrics):** You need baseline yield data to calculate LER and know if it's working
- **Stack 2 (Efficiency):** Your operations need to be tight enough to handle additional complexity
- **Stack 3 (Circularity):** Understanding nutrient flows helps you choose complementary crops

If you're still struggling with single-crop efficiency, intercropping adds complexity you're not ready for. Get your foundation solid first.

If you've got Stacks 1-3 in place and want to reduce vulnerability to single-crop risk, intercropping is worth testing on a portion of your operation.
