## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & SCOPING (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Stakeholder Requirements & Operation Mapping

**Objective:** Understand what data stakeholders actually need and map where your operation generates emissions/uses resources.

#### Activities

**1. Stakeholder Requirements Analysis (90 minutes)**

Who's asking for sustainability data (or will ask soon)?
- Buyers/customers
- Banks/lenders/investors  
- Certification bodies
- Regulatory requirements (direct or indirect through supply chain)
- Internal management needs

For each stakeholder:
- What specific metrics do they request/require?
- What documentation level is needed? (estimates → verified data)
- What deadlines exist? (buyer request dates, certification application dates)
- What format do they want? (questionnaire, report, certification standard)

**Template:** Stakeholder Requirements Matrix (Excel - Tab 1 of Week 1 Workbook)

**2. Operation Mapping (2 hours)**

Create complete inventory of emission sources and resource use points across your operation:

**Energy sources:**
- Electricity (which meters, which buildings/processes)
- Diesel (machinery, generators, irrigation pumps)
- Gasoline (vehicles, small equipment)
- Natural gas / Propane (heating, drying, processing)
- Renewable energy (solar panels, biogas)

**Water sources:**
- Municipal supply (which meters)
- Wells (how many, what used for)
- Surface water (ponds, streams - permits/extraction volumes)
- Rainwater collection
- Irrigation systems (type, area covered, power source)

**Agricultural emissions:**
- Livestock (species, numbers, housing type)
- Manure management (storage type, application method)
- Soil management (tilled area, fertilizer application)
- Land use (production area, conservation areas, other)

**Waste streams:**
- Organic waste (crop residues, food waste, manure)
- Recyclables (plastic, paper, metal, packaging)
- General waste (landfill)
- Hazardous waste (pesticide containers, oils, batteries)

**Inputs:**
- Fertilizers (products used, application rates, areas)
- Pesticides (products, application frequency, areas)
- Feed (livestock operations - types, volumes)
- Other materials (seeds, packaging, amendments)

**Template:** Operation Mapping Worksheet (Excel - Tab 2 of Week 1 Workbook)

**3. Preliminary Metric Selection (60 minutes)**

Based on stakeholder requirements + operation mapping, identify which metrics are:
- **Essential:** Stakeholder-required or regulation-mandated
- **Important:** Not required but adds credibility/competitive advantage
- **Optional:** Nice-to-have but lower priority

Focus on 5-7 core metrics. Don't try to measure everything.

**Typical agricultural operation core set:**
1. Energy consumption (kWh + fuel volumes) → Scope 1 + 2 emissions
2. Water consumption (total volume + by source)
3. Waste generation (by stream + diversion rate)
4. Land use (production area + biodiversity areas)
5. Fertilizer efficiency (kg N/P/K per hectare or per output unit)
6. Operational emissions (enteric fermentation, manure, soil N2O - if livestock/arable)
7. Production output (yield/volume - for intensity metrics)

**Template:** Metric Prioritization Matrix (Excel - Tab 3 of Week 1 Workbook)

#### Week 1 Deliverables

✅ **Completed Stakeholder Requirements Matrix** - You know what data buyers/banks/certifications need

✅ **Operation Mapping Worksheet** - Complete inventory of emission sources and resource use

✅ **Prioritized Metric List** - Your 5-7 core metrics ranked by importance

✅ **Resource Allocation Plan** - Who's responsible for what in baseline building (names, time allocation)

#### Quality Gate: Proceed to Week 2 Only If...

- [ ] You've identified at least one specific stakeholder who needs (or will need) sustainability data
- [ ] Your operation mapping covers all major energy/water/waste/land sources
- [ ] Your metric list has 5-7 items maximum (not 15+ trying to measure everything)
- [ ] Someone is designated as project lead with 4-6 hours/week allocated

#### Common Week 1 Pitfalls

❌ **Metric overload:** Trying to measure 15+ metrics leads to paralysis. Start with 5-7 core metrics.

❌ **Perfection seeking:** You don't need complete information to start. Document what you know, flag what's missing.

❌ **No stakeholder deadline:** Without real buyer/bank deadline pressure, baseline projects stall. Create artificial deadline if needed.

❌ **Solo hero mode:** One person doing everything burns out by week 4. Distribute tasks even if you're small operation.

---

### Week 2: Data Source Inventory & Quick Win Identification

**Objective:** Identify existing data sources you can tap immediately, and flag where you'll need to build new data collection.

#### Activities

**1. Existing Data Source Inventory (2.5 hours)**

You already collect more data than you realize. Hunt down:

**Utility bills / Energy records:**
- Electricity bills (last 12+ months) - kWh consumption, cost, meter IDs
- Fuel purchase records (diesel, gas, propane - volumes, dates, equipment used)
- Heating bills (natural gas, propane, oil - volumes or costs)
- Solar production data (if applicable - kWh generated)

**Water records:**
- Municipal water bills (volume, cost)
- Well logs (if metered - extraction volumes)
- Irrigation scheduling records (hours run, area covered, flow rates)

**Waste management records:**
- Hauler invoices (pickup frequency, bin sizes, costs)
- Recycling records (volumes or weights if available)
- Compost production logs (if composting on-site)

**Production records:**
- Yield data (kg, tonnes, liters harvested by crop/product)
- Quality grades (if sorted/classified)
- Sales records (can back-calculate production if direct harvest data missing)

**Input purchase records:**
- Fertilizer invoices (product name, N-P-K analysis, quantity purchased)
- Pesticide application logs or purchase records
- Feed purchase records (livestock - type, quantity, dates)
- Seed/planting material purchases

**Asset & equipment records:**
- Machinery list (make, model, fuel type, usage hours if tracked)
- Building/facility inventory (size, age, heating/cooling systems)
- Irrigation equipment specs (pump capacity, pipe lengths, efficiency ratings)

**Template:** Data Source Inventory Checklist (Excel - Tab 1 of Week 2 Workbook)

For each data source:
- ✅ **Found** - Have data, know where it is, can access it
- ⚠️ **Partial** - Have some data, gaps exist, need to improve collection
- ❌ **Missing** - Don't have data, need to start measuring

**2. Quick Win Identification (90 minutes)**

What can you measure THIS MONTH with data you already have?

**Example quick wins:**
- **Electricity baseline:** 12 months of utility bills → immediate kWh baseline + Scope 2 emissions
- **Fuel consumption:** Purchase records → volumes by fuel type → Scope 1 emissions
- **Waste baseline:** Hauler invoices → bin size × frequency → waste volumes
- **Land use:** Property records + production area mapping → baseline metric
- **Production output:** Sales or harvest records → yield baselines

**Template:** Quick Win Worksheet (Excel - Tab 2 of Week 2 Workbook)

Identify:
- What data you can compile this week
- What calculations you can complete immediately
- What early baseline metrics you can establish before Week 12

**3. Data Gap Analysis (60 minutes)**

Where do you NOT have data? What's missing?

**Common gaps:**
- Water consumption (if no meters on wells)
- Equipment fuel consumption (if buying bulk and not tracking individual machine use)
- Process-level energy use (if only have whole-site electricity, can't allocate to specific operations)
- Waste composition (if hauler doesn't provide weights, only bin sizes)
- Detailed fertilizer application (if purchase records exist but application area/timing not logged)

**For each gap, classify:**
- **Critical:** Stakeholder-required, must fix
- **Important:** Adds accuracy/credibility, should fix
- **Minor:** Nice-to-have, lower priority

**Then determine fix timeline:**
- **Immediate (Weeks 3-4):** Simple fixes, zero/low cost (start logging data, install manual meter checks)
- **Short-term (Months 2-6):** Low-cost investments (basic sensors, improved logging protocols)
- **Long-term (Year 2+):** Strategic investments (automated monitoring, software platforms)

**Template:** Data Gap Analysis & Solution Roadmap (Excel - Tab 3 of Week 2 Workbook)

#### Week 2 Deliverables

✅ **Data Source Inventory** - Complete list of what data exists, where it is, quality level

✅ **Quick Win List** - Metrics you can baseline immediately with existing data (target: 2-3 metrics)

✅ **Data Gap Analysis** - What's missing, criticality rating, timeline for fixes

✅ **Month 1 Data Collection Plan** - Start gathering data for gaps this month

#### Quality Gate: Proceed to Week 3 Only If...

- [ ] You've located at least 12 months of data for 2+ core metrics (even if quality is imperfect)
- [ ] You have a complete gap inventory showing what's missing
- [ ] Quick wins identified - you can calculate at least 1-2 baselines with existing data
- [ ] Someone is assigned to start collecting gap data this month (don't wait until Week 6)

#### Common Week 2 Pitfalls

❌ **Data hunting paralysis:** Spending weeks searching for perfect historical data. Accept gaps, document them, start measuring now.

❌ **Giving up too easily:** "We don't have that data" → dig deeper. Utility bills might be in accountant's files. Fertilizer data might be in agronomist records.

❌ **No immediate data collection start:** Gap analysis becomes theoretical. If you're missing well water data, start manual weekly meter checks NOW.

❌ **Ignoring obvious proxies:** Don't have direct measurements? Fuel purchases + equipment types = decent consumption estimates. Some data beats no data.

## PHASE 2: DATA COLLECTION INFRASTRUCTURE (Weeks 3-5)

### Week 3: Collection Systems Setup & Baseline Period Selection

**Objective:** Establish systematic data collection processes and define what time period you're measuring.

#### Activities

**1. Baseline Period Selection (45 minutes)**

Choose the time window you'll use for baseline measurements.

**Common approaches:**
- **Calendar year:** Jan 1 - Dec 31 of most recent complete year
- **Fiscal year:** Aligns with your financial reporting
- **Growing season:** Full crop cycle (sowing to harvest)
- **Rolling 12 months:** Most recent 12-month period

**Selection criteria:**
- **Completeness:** Do you have data for the full period?
- **Representativeness:** Does it capture normal operations? (Avoid years with unusual events)
- **Stakeholder alignment:** Does it match reporting windows buyers/certifications expect?
- **Data quality:** Period with most complete/reliable data

**Recommendation:** Use most recent complete calendar year with adequate data. If current year incomplete, use previous year and note you're updating to current year as data becomes available.

**Document your decision:**
- Baseline period: [Start date] to [End date]
- Rationale: Why this period chosen
- Limitations: What makes it imperfect (gaps, unusual events, data quality issues)
- Update plan: When you'll refresh baseline with new data

**Template:** Baseline Period Definition (Word template - Section 1 of Methodology Statement)

**2. Data Collection System Design (3 hours)**

For each core metric, establish WHO collects WHAT data WHEN and HOW.

**System components:**

**Data collection templates** (use included Excel templates, customize as needed)
- Utility Data Collection Form
- Production Records Form
- Input Purchase Tracking Form
- Waste Management Log
- Equipment Usage Log

**Collection frequency:**
- **Monthly:** Utility bills, waste hauler invoices, major input purchases
- **Weekly:** Production outputs, irrigation hours, equipment usage
- **Daily:** Process-specific data if needed (rarely required for baselines)
- **Quarterly:** Less frequent data (some input applications, maintenance)

**Responsible parties:**
- Assign each data stream to specific person
- Backup person for when primary is unavailable
- Review person (quality check - should be different from collector)

**Data flow:**
- Where does data originate? (invoices, meter readings, logbooks)
- Who enters it into templates? (farm manager, admin, specialist)
- Where are templates stored? (shared drive, cloud folder, physical binder)
- How often is data transferred to calculation worksheets? (monthly recommended)

**Template:** Data Collection System Design (Excel - Tab 1 of Week 3 Workbook)

Includes:
- Responsibility assignment matrix (who does what)
- Collection schedule (when data is gathered/entered)
- Data flow diagram (from source to calculation)
- Template usage instructions

**3. Historical Data Recovery (2 hours)**

Systematically gather existing historical data for baseline period.

**Hunt down:**
- 12+ months utility bills (request from providers if missing)
- Production records from past year
- Input purchase invoices (from suppliers or accounting records)
- Equipment service records (can indicate fuel consumption patterns)
- Waste management invoices

**Organization protocol:**
- Create digital folder: "Baseline Data / [Metric] / [Year-Month]"
- Scan paper records if needed
- Name files consistently: "YYYY-MM_Electricity_Bill.pdf"
- Log each document in Source Data Log (documentation template included)

**For missing periods:**
- Estimate conservatively using available data
- Document estimation method clearly
- Flag for replacement with measured data as it becomes available

**Template:** Historical Data Recovery Checklist + Source Data Log (Excel - Tab 2 of Week 3 Workbook)

#### Week 3 Deliverables

✅ **Baseline Period Definition Document** - Clear statement of what time period you're measuring and why

✅ **Data Collection System** - Templates assigned, frequency set, responsibilities clear

✅ **Historical Data File** - Organized digital folder with recovered baseline period data

✅ **Source Data Log** - Tracking what data you have, where it came from, quality flags

#### Quality Gate: Proceed to Week 4 Only If...

- [ ] Baseline period is defined and documented (start/end dates + rationale)
- [ ] Data collection templates are assigned to specific people with clear deadlines
- [ ] You've recovered at least 6 months of historical data for 2+ metrics
- [ ] Source Data Log is started (even if not complete - it's a living document)

#### Common Week 3 Pitfalls

❌ **No accountability:** Templates exist but no specific person is responsible for filling them. Assign names + deadlines.

❌ **Too complex too soon:** Trying to track 20 data streams daily. Start simple - monthly utility data beats nothing.

❌ **Digital chaos:** Files scattered across email, desktop, multiple folders. Create ONE organized location from day one.

❌ **Analysis paralysis on period selection:** Pick a period, document limitations, move forward. Perfect period doesn't exist.

## Post-Week 12: Maintenance & Continuous Improvement

**You've built the baseline. Now what?**

Your measurement infrastructure should operate routinely going forward:

**Monthly routine (2 hours/month):**
- Collect utility bills, invoices, production data
- Enter into ongoing tracking worksheets
- Run quality checks (flag anomalies)
- Update rolling metrics

**Quarterly review (3 hours/quarter):**
- Trend analysis - are metrics moving as expected?
- Gap closure progress - are you fixing identified weaknesses?
- Stakeholder communication - proactive updates to buyers
- System improvement - refine templates based on user experience

**Annual refresh (1-2 days/year):**
- Update baseline with most recent 12 months data
- Methodology review - are your approaches still appropriate?
- External verification preparation (if required)
- Improvement target setting - where do you want metrics to move?

**Year 2-3 maturity path:**
- Replace estimates with measured data as collection improves
- Increase measurement granularity where value exists (process-level not just site-level)
- Technology adoption where ROI is clear (sensors, software)
- Verification readiness for third-party audit

## Appendix: Troubleshooting Common Implementation Challenges

**"We're stuck in Week 3 - can't find historical data"**
→ Set baseline period as "12 months forward from [today's date]" and measure prospectively. Document that historical data wasn't available. Start measuring now with clear methodology.

**"Our operation has seasonal variation - simple annual totals don't capture reality"**
→ Break baseline into seasonal periods (e.g., growing season vs off-season). Calculate intensity metrics that normalize for production levels. Document seasonal patterns in methodology statement.

**"Multiple people supposed to collect data but no one is doing it"**
→ Single point of ownership is essential. Designate one person as Data Lead even in small operations. They chase others for inputs, but accountability sits with one role.

**"Data exists but is too messy to use"**
→ Clean data for baseline period manually (time-consuming but necessary once). Going forward, implement clean entry protocols. Garbage-in-garbage-out kills credibility.

**"Stakeholders want data we can't provide yet"**
→ Communicate transparently: "We're building measurement infrastructure now. We can provide [these metrics] immediately and will have [other metrics] by [date]." Most buyers accept honest timelines.

**"We started strong but lost momentum by Week 6"**
→ Common. Review resource allocation - was 4-6 hours/week realistic? Adjust timeline to 16-20 weeks if needed. Completion matters more than speed.

## Next Steps After Baseline Completion

**With defensible baselines established, you can:**

1. **Respond to stakeholder requests** - Confidently answer buyer questionnaires, bank ESG questions, certification applications

2. **Identify improvement opportunities** - Your data reveals where resources are wasted (→ Stack 2: Operational Efficiency)

3. **Set improvement targets** - Evidence-based goals ("Reduce energy 10% vs baseline") not vague commitments

4. **Communicate proactively** - Share baseline data with buyers before they ask (preferred supplier positioning)

5. **Pursue certification** - Many sustainability certifications require baseline measurements as starting point

6. **Build business case** - Stack 3 shows how to transform sustainability data into new revenue streams

**The foundation is built. Now you can build value on top of it.**
