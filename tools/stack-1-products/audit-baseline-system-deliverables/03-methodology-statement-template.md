# Sustainability Baseline Methodology Statement

**[Your Farm/Company Name]**  
**Baseline Period:** [Start Date] to [End Date]  
**Report Date:** [Date]  
**Prepared by:** [Name, Role]

---

## Executive Summary

*[2-3 paragraphs summarizing: what you measured, why, key results, data quality level]*

This methodology statement documents the approach used by [Farm/Company Name] to establish baseline sustainability performance measurements for [baseline period]. The baseline was developed to support [purpose: buyer sustainability requirements / certification application / internal performance tracking / ESG reporting / other].

The baseline covers [X] core sustainability metrics: [list metrics - e.g., energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, water use, waste generation, land use, input efficiency]. Measurements follow [standards followed - e.g., GHG Protocol, ISO 14064, specific certification requirements] and are based on [data sources - e.g., utility records, production data, purchase invoices].

Key baseline results:
- Total energy consumption: [value + unit]
- Total GHG emissions (Scope 1+2): [value] tonnes CO2e
- Water consumption: [value + unit]
- [Other key metrics]

Data quality is assessed as [high/medium/acceptable] for [stakeholder purpose], with known limitations documented in Section 6. [If verified: This baseline has been third-party verified by [Organization] in [Month Year].]

## 1. Organizational Context

### 1.1 Organization Description

**Legal Entity:** [Full legal company name, registration number if relevant]

**Primary Business Activity:** [Description of what you produce/do]
- [Crop production - which crops, area farmed]
- [Livestock production - which species, head count]
- [Processing/value-adding activities]
- [Other activities]

**Location(s):** [Address(es) of site(s) included in baseline]

**Operation Scale:**
- Land area: [hectares total; production area; conservation/non-production area]
- Staff: [number of employees / seasonal workers]
- Annual production: [volume/value]
- Annual revenue: [€ if comfortable disclosing, or "€X-Y million range"]

### 1.2 Organizational Boundary

*[Define what organizational entities are included/excluded from baseline]*

**Included in this baseline:**
- [All owned and operated facilities at [location]]
- [Specific production activities: field operations, post-harvest processing, storage, on-site administration]
- [Owned equipment and vehicles]

**Excluded from this baseline:**
- [Off-site leased facilities, if any]
- [Contracted services (custom harvesting, aerial spraying, transport beyond farm gate)]
- [Product use by customers]
- [Other exclusions]

**Rationale for boundary:** *[Explain why you drew the boundary here - typically: operational control, data availability, stakeholder requirements]*

The organizational boundary follows the **[operational control / financial control / equity share]** approach. [Farm/Company Name] has operational control over all included facilities and activities, meaning we have full authority to implement operational policies and practices.

### 1.3 Reporting Period

**Baseline Period:** [Start Date] to [End Date]

**Rationale for period selection:**
*[Explain why you chose this specific 12-month window]*

This period was selected because:
- [It represents a complete production cycle / calendar year / fiscal year]
- [Data availability is highest for this period]
- [It aligns with [buyer/certification] reporting requirements]
- [It avoids unusual circumstances that occurred in [other period]]

**Known limitations of baseline period:**
- [Any unusual events: weather extremes, equipment failures, production disruptions]
- [Data gaps or quality issues specific to this period]
- [Other factors affecting representativeness]

## 2. Metrics Included in Baseline

*[List and define each metric you measured]*

### 2.1 Core Metrics Summary

| Metric | Unit | Included? | Data Quality* | Stakeholder Priority |
|--------|------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Energy consumption | GJ | ✓ | High | Buyer requirement |
| GHG emissions (Scope 1+2) | tonnes CO2e | ✓ | High | Buyer requirement |
| Water consumption | m³ | ✓ | Medium | Certification |
| Waste generation | tonnes | ✓ | Medium | Internal priority |
| Land use | hectares | ✓ | High | Certification |
| Fertilizer efficiency | kg N/ha | ✓ | Medium | Internal priority |
| [Other metrics] | | | | |

*Data quality scale: High = verified measurements; Medium = reliable estimates; Low = rough estimates

### 2.2 Metric Definitions

**2.2.1 Energy Consumption**

**Definition:** Total energy consumed from all sources (electricity, diesel, gasoline, natural gas, propane, other fuels) across all included operations, converted to gigajoules (GJ).

**Boundary:** All energy consumed by owned/operated equipment and facilities. Excludes energy embedded in purchased inputs (fertilizer manufacturing, feed production) - these are covered in Scope 3 if calculated.

**Calculation approach:** Activity data (kWh, liters, m³) × conversion factors to GJ. See Section 3.2 for detailed methodology.

**Why we measure this:** Energy consumption is the primary driver of operational costs and GHG emissions. Buyers require energy data for Scope 3 supply chain reporting. Tracking enables efficiency improvement identification.

---

**2.2.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scope 1 + Scope 2)**

**Definition:** Total greenhouse gas emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), covering:
- Scope 1 (Direct): Emissions from fuel combustion in owned/operated equipment
- Scope 2 (Indirect): Emissions from purchased electricity generation (location-based method)

**Gases included:** CO2, CH4, N2O converted to CO2e using IPCC AR5 global warming potentials (CH4 = 28, N2O = 265). *[Note: Some standards use AR4 values - document which you use]*

**Boundary:** Emissions from energy consumption within organizational boundary. Excludes:
- Scope 3 emissions (upstream/downstream value chain) - [calculated separately in Section 2.2.7 OR not included in this baseline]
- Non-energy agricultural emissions (enteric fermentation, manure, soil N2O) - [calculated separately in Section 2.2.6 OR not included]

**Calculation approach:** Activity data × emission factors from [IPCC 2006 Guidelines / EPA / DEFRA / IEA]. See Section 3.3 for detailed methodology.

**Why we measure this:** GHG emissions are the primary sustainability metric buyers track. Mandatory for [buyer name] supplier requirements. Enables participation in carbon markets and access to green financing.

---

**2.2.3 Water Consumption**

**Definition:** Total water withdrawn from all sources (municipal supply, wells, surface water, rainwater) for all operational uses (irrigation, livestock, processing, cleaning, domestic).

**Measurement approach:** 
- Municipal water: Metered consumption from utility bills
- Well water: [Metered extraction OR estimated from pump capacity × operating hours OR other methodology]
- Surface water: [Permitted extraction volume OR estimated from irrigation system capacity × run time]
- Rainwater: [Metered OR estimated from collection area × rainfall]

**Boundary:** All water withdrawn within organizational boundary. Excludes:
- Rainfall directly on fields (not withdrawn/used)
- Water naturally flowing through property without extraction
- Embedded water in purchased inputs

**Why we measure this:** Water availability is critical operational constraint. [Certification/buyer] requires water use reporting. Efficiency improvements reduce costs in [region with water scarcity/cost].

*[Continue similar format for each metric you're including: waste, land use, fertilizer efficiency, agricultural emissions, etc.]*

---

## 3. Data Sources and Calculation Methodologies

*[For each metric, document: where data comes from, how you calculate the metric, what standards/factors you use]*

### 3.1 Data Collection Overview

**Data management approach:**
- Source data (utility bills, invoices, production records) collected monthly
- Data entered into standardized Excel templates [Tool name: Audit-Defensible Baseline System]
- Quality checks performed quarterly [by: Name, Role]
- Supporting documents filed digitally in structured folder system: [Folder location/structure]

**Data retention:** All source documents retained for [X years] to support verification and auditing.

### 3.2 Energy Consumption Methodology

**3.2.1 Electricity**

**Data sources:**
- Utility bills from [Supplier name(s)]
- Meter IDs: [List meter IDs if multiple meters]
- Frequency: Monthly billing data

**Collection process:**
- Bills received from [supplier/accounts department]
- kWh consumption extracted from bills
- Data entered into Energy & Emissions Calculator spreadsheet
- Monthly totals reviewed for anomalies (spikes, drops, missing data)

**Calculation:**
Total Electricity (kWh) = Σ Monthly consumption (Jan-Dec)
Total Electricity (GJ) = kWh × 0.0036 (conversion factor)

**Data quality:** [High - all 12 months actual meter readings] OR [Medium - X months estimated due to missing bills, estimation method: average of prior/subsequent months]

**Quality checks:**
- Month-over-month comparison (flag changes >30% for investigation)
- Year-over-year comparison to prior years if available
- Comparison to expected consumption based on operational activity levels

---

**3.2.2 Diesel**

**Data sources:**
- [Purchase invoices from fuel suppliers] OR [Equipment-level fuel consumption logs]
- Supplier(s): [Name(s)]
- Frequency: [As purchased - irregular] OR [Weekly logging]

**Collection process:**
*[Option A: Purchase-based]*
- Fuel purchase invoices compiled from accounting records
- Liters purchased extracted from invoices
- Allocated to baseline period based on purchase date
- Assumes purchases approximately equal consumption (acceptable for baseline if no significant fuel storage changes)

*[Option B: Equipment-based - more accurate if you do this]*
- Equipment operators log fuel consumption per machine/vehicle
- Daily/weekly logs compiled monthly
- Total consumption by equipment category tallied annually

**Calculation:**
Total Diesel (liters) = Σ Fuel purchases [or consumption logs]
Total Diesel (GJ) = Liters × 0.0383 (conversion factor, higher heating value)

**Known limitations:**
- [Purchase-based approach may not match exact consumption if fuel storage levels changed significantly during baseline period - estimated impact: <5%]
- [Equipment-level logging not available for all machines - estimated vs actual fuel use for: X, Y, Z equipment]

**Data quality:** [High / Medium / Low - explain]

---

**3.2.3 [Continue for gasoline, natural gas, other fuels]**

---

### 3.3 GHG Emissions Methodology

**Standards followed:** 
- GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 & 2)
- ISO 14064-1:2018 (organizational GHG inventories)
- [Specific buyer/certification standard if applicable]

**Global Warming Potentials:** IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) - 100 year time horizon
- CO2 = 1
- CH4 = 28 (some standards use 25 from AR4 - we use AR5)
- N2O = 265 (some standards use 298 from AR4 - we use AR5)

*[Note: Document which GWP version you use as this affects results. Be consistent.]*

**3.3.1 Scope 1 Emissions (Direct)**

**Sources included:**
- Diesel combustion (tractors, vehicles, pumps, generators, dryers)
- Gasoline combustion (small equipment, vehicles)
- Natural gas combustion (heating, processing)
- Propane combustion (heating, drying)

**Calculation approach:** Tier 1 methodology (activity data × emission factors)

**Emission factors:**

| Fuel | Emission Factor | Unit | Source |
|------|----------------|------|--------|
| Diesel | 2.68 | kg CO2e/liter | IPCC 2006 Guidelines, Volume 2 (Energy), Table 1.4 |
| Gasoline | 2.31 | kg CO2e/liter | IPCC 2006 Guidelines, Volume 2 (Energy), Table 1.4 |
| Natural Gas | 2.03 | kg CO2e/m³ | IPCC 2006 Guidelines, Volume 2 (Energy), Table 1.3 |
| Propane (LPG) | 2.98 | kg CO2e/kg | IPCC 2006 Guidelines, Volume 2 (Energy), Table 1.3 |

*[Note: These factors include CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from fuel combustion. Higher heating value (HHV) basis.]*

**Calculation:**
Scope 1 Emissions (kg CO2e) = Σ (Fuel consumed × Emission factor) for all fuels
Scope 1 Emissions (tonnes CO2e) = kg CO2e ÷ 1000

---

**3.3.2 Scope 2 Emissions (Indirect - Electricity)**

**Methodology:** Location-based method (using grid average emission factor)

*[Note: Market-based method would use supplier-specific factors if renewable energy purchased. We use location-based as standard approach for agricultural baselines.]*

**Grid emission factor:**
- Region: [Germany / France / Your Country]
- Emission factor: [0.XXX] kg CO2e/kWh
- Source: IEA 2023, [Country] electricity grid emission intensity
- Year: 2023 (most recent available)

**Calculation:**
Scope 2 Emissions (kg CO2e) = Total kWh consumed × Grid emission factor
Scope 2 Emissions (tonnes CO2e) = kg CO2e ÷ 1000

**Renewable energy note:**
[If applicable: We generated [X] kWh from on-site solar PV. Under location-based method, this does not reduce Scope 2 emissions but is reported separately as avoided emissions. Renewable generation = [X] kWh × [grid EF] = [Y] tonnes CO2e avoided.]

---

**3.3.3 [If including agricultural emissions: enteric fermentation, manure, soil N2O]**

*[This section would detail IPCC Tier 1 or Tier 2 methodologies for agricultural non-CO2 emissions. Complex and specific to livestock/crop type. Template would guide through livestock population data, manure management systems, fertilizer application data, calculation steps using IPCC equations.]*

### 3.4 Water Consumption Methodology

*[Similar detailed breakdown: data sources, collection process, calculation, quality assessment]*

---

### 3.5 [Continue for each metric]

---

## 4. Data Quality Assessment

*[Document quality level for each metric and overall baseline confidence]*

### 4.1 Data Quality Scoring

We assess data quality on a 5-point scale:

**5 - Verified measurement:** Meter readings, third-party verified invoices, certified records  
**4 - Reliable estimate:** Based on documented equipment specs × tracked usage, strong supporting data  
**3 - Reasonable estimate:** Industry averages applied to our context, logical assumptions  
**2 - Rough estimate:** Limited supporting data, multiple assumptions  
**1 - Guess:** No supporting data, purely indicative  

### 4.2 Quality Assessment by Metric

| Metric | Quality Score | Justification | Improvement Plan |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Energy - Electricity | 5 | All 12 months actual meter readings from utility bills | None needed |
| Energy - Diesel | 4 | Purchase invoices for all diesel, assumes consumption ≈ purchases | Year 2: Implement equipment-level logging |
| Energy - Gasoline | 3 | Estimated from vehicle/equipment specs × estimated hours | Year 2: Start fuel logging for major equipment |
| GHG Emissions | 4-5 | Calculated from energy data (quality 3-5) using standard factors | Improve as energy data quality improves |
| Water | 3 | Municipal metered (quality 5), well water estimated from pump capacity × hours run (quality 2) | Year 2: Install well water meters |
| Waste | 4 | Hauler invoices show bin sizes × pickup frequency, volume calculated | Consider weighing waste periodically for verification |
| [Other] | | | |
| **OVERALL** | **4.2** | Acceptable for baseline reporting to buyers | Continue improving scores <4 |

### 4.3 Overall Data Confidence

**Baseline confidence level:** [High / Medium / Acceptable] for [intended use: buyer reporting / certification / internal tracking]

**Strengths:**
- [Energy consumption well-documented from utility records]
- [Production output verified through sales records]
- [Clear methodology following recognized standards]

**Known limitations:**
- [Well water consumption estimated rather than metered - affects water baseline accuracy]
- [Equipment-level fuel consumption not tracked - reduces ability to identify specific efficiency opportunities]
- [Waste composition unknown - bin volumes don't distinguish recycling rates accurately]

**Mitigation of limitations:**
- [Conservative estimates used where measurements not available]
- [Estimation methods documented clearly]
- [Plans to improve measurement in Year 2 identified]

### 4.4 Uncertainty Quantification

*[For sophisticated stakeholders, quantify uncertainty ranges]*

| Metric | Estimated Uncertainty | Confidence Interval |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Energy - Electricity | ±2% | 95% confident actual within ±2% of reported value |
| Energy - Diesel | ±10% | Purchase-based method may miss timing differences |
| GHG Emissions - Scope 1 | ±10% | Driven by fuel consumption uncertainty |
| GHG Emissions - Scope 2 | ±5% | Emission factor uncertainty plus meter uncertainty |
| [Others] | | |

**Overall baseline uncertainty:** Approximately ±10% for total GHG emissions, ±5% for total energy, ±15% for water.

**Implications:** These uncertainty ranges are acceptable for:
- ✓ Buyer supplier sustainability questionnaires  
- ✓ Internal performance tracking and improvement identification  
- ✓ Most certification baseline requirements  
- ? Third-party verification (may require improvement in some areas - assessable)  
- ✗ Carbon credit programs requiring <5% uncertainty (not yet at this level)

---

## 5. Assumptions and Exclusions

*[Document all significant assumptions and what you deliberately excluded]*

### 5.1 Key Assumptions

**Assumption 1: Fuel purchases ≈ fuel consumption**

**Context:** Diesel and gasoline baseline based on purchase invoices rather than metered consumption.

**Assumption:** Purchases during baseline period approximately equal consumption (i.e., fuel storage levels didn't change significantly).

**Impact if wrong:** If we built up fuel inventory during baseline period without using it, reported consumption would be overstated. If we drew down inventory, consumption would be understated.

**Mitigation:** Checked fuel storage levels at start/end of period - no significant change detected. Estimated maximum impact: <5% of fuel baseline.

**Justification:** Purchase-based approach is acceptable for initial baselines per GHG Protocol guidance when metering not available.

---

**Assumption 2: [Document each significant assumption]**

---

### 5.2 Exclusions

**What we deliberately excluded and why:**

**Scope 3 Emissions (Value Chain)**

**Excluded:**
- Purchased goods and services (fertilizer production, feed production, equipment manufacturing)
- Upstream transportation of purchased inputs
- Downstream transportation and product use
- Business travel
- Employee commuting

**Rationale:** Buyer requirements currently focus on Scope 1+2. Scope 3 would require extensive supplier data not currently available. May be added in future baselines if stakeholder requirements evolve.

**Estimated significance:** Scope 3 (especially purchased fertilizer and feed) likely represents [larger than / smaller than] Scope 1+2 combined. Not including does not diminish value of Scope 1+2 baseline for current purposes.

---

**[Other exclusions - document each]**

---

## 6. Limitations and Future Improvements

*[Be honest about weaknesses and what you'll fix]*

### 6.1 Current Limitations

**Limitation 1: Well water consumption estimated**

**Issue:** Well water extraction not metered. Consumption estimated from irrigation pump capacity × logged hours run.

**Impact:** Water baseline has ±20% uncertainty. Cannot accurately track water efficiency improvements or respond to detailed water use questions from buyers.

**Improvement plan:** Install water meters on all well systems by [Month Year]. Cost: €[X]. Payback through improved management and buyer credibility: [timeline].

---

**Limitation 2: Process-level energy allocation not available**

**Issue:** Whole-site electricity meter - cannot break down consumption by process (irrigation vs. cold storage vs. grain drying).

**Impact:** Cannot identify where energy efficiency improvements would be most valuable. Limits ability to optimize operations.

**Improvement plan:** Phase 1 (Year 2): Install sub-meters on three highest consumption processes. Phase 2 (Year 3): Full process-level metering if ROI demonstrated.

---

*[Continue for each significant limitation]*

---

### 6.2 Multi-Year Improvement Roadmap

**Year 2 Priorities:**
1. [Install well water meters - improves water baseline from quality 3 to quality 5]
2. [Implement equipment fuel logging - improves diesel/gasoline baseline quality]
3. [Quarterly data review routine - catches errors earlier]

**Year 3 Goals:**
1. [Process-level energy metering - enables optimization]
2. [Waste composition analysis - enables diversion rate improvement]
3. [Third-party verification preparation]

**Long-term (Year 4+):**
1. [Automated data collection systems (IoT sensors)]
2. [Scope 3 baseline development if stakeholder requirements evolve]
3. [Carbon credit program participation if reduction targets achieved]
