## APPENDIX: TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON DATA COLLECTION ISSUES

**Issue: Bill hasn't arrived yet, but it's time to complete monthly tracking**

**Solution:**
1. Estimate consumption based on previous month or same month last year
2. Flag as "ESTIMATED" in bright highlight
3. Replace with actual data when bill arrives
4. Document in notes: "March bill delayed - estimated from Feb actual, updated [date] with actual"

---

**Issue: Bill shows "estimated" meter reading (supplier didn't get actual reading)**

**Solution:**
1. Use the estimated value if that's all you have
2. Flag as "SUPPLIER ESTIMATE" 
3. Data quality = Medium (not High)
4. When actual reading arrives next month, check if adjustment needed
5. Document: "Jan-Feb estimated by supplier, adjusted in March actual reading"

---

**Issue: Multiple deliveries in one month, unclear which was for which equipment**

**Solution:**
1. Sum total deliveries for the month
2. In "Intended Use" column, note "Mixed - field ops + irrigation" or similar
3. Equipment-level allocation is nice-to-have but not essential for baseline
4. Consider implementing fuel logs going forward if allocation matters

---

**Issue: Lost or missing bill for a month**

**Solution:**
1. Contact supplier to request duplicate/copy
2. If unavailable, estimate using: (Previous month + Following month) ÷ 2
3. Clearly flag as "ESTIMATED - bill not available"
4. Data quality = Low for that month
5. Document: "April electricity estimated (bill lost) - average of Mar + May"

---

**Issue: Consumption spike seems wrong - is it real or data error?**

**Investigation protocol:**
1. Check bill carefully - did billing period length change? (Some bills are 28 days, some 35)
2. Check meter reading math - does Current - Previous = Consumption shown?
3. Check for operational explanation - did seasonal equipment start? Weather extreme?
4. If spike is real and explainable, document reason
5. If spike seems like error, contact supplier to verify
6. Don't just assume it's wrong - investigate

---

**Issue: Well water extraction hours not logged consistently**

**Solution (Short-term):**
1. Estimate hours based on irrigated area + crop water requirements
2. Flag as "ESTIMATED" with low data quality
3. Document estimation method

**Solution (Long-term):**
1. Implement daily/weekly irrigation logging (who, when, how long)
2. Consider pump hour meter installation
3. Ultimate: Install flow meters on wells for accurate measurement

---

**Issue: Multiple people receive bills (accountant, farm manager, etc.) - hard to collect**

**Solution:**
1. Designate ONE person as utility data coordinator
2. Set up email forwarding rule: all utility bills → coordinator
3. Create shared digital folder where bills are automatically saved
4. Monthly reminder for coordinator to compile data
5. Backup: quarterly audit to catch any missed bills

**End of Utility Data Collection Template**

---

**BEST PRACTICES FOR SUCCESS:**

✅ **Do this monthly, not quarterly/annually** - Waiting until year-end to compile 12 months of data is overwhelming and error-prone

✅ **Review data as you enter it** - Catch obvious errors immediately (consumption spike, decimal place mistake)

✅ **Keep source documents organized** - Future-you (or auditor) needs to find that September electricity bill easily

✅ **Have someone else check your work** - Data entry errors are common; second pair of eyes catches them

✅ **Document unusual circumstances immediately** - You won't remember in 6 months why July diesel was 3× normal

✅ **Start simple, improve over time** - Don't let pursuit of perfection prevent starting basic tracking

**This template is the workhorse of your baseline system.** It's unglamorous monthly data entry, but it creates the audit trail that makes your baseline credible. Invest 20 minutes/month now, save hours of scrambling later when buyers ask questions.
