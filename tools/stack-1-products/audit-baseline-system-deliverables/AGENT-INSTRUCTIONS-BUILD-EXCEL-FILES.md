# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS: Building Excel Files for Audit-Defensible Baseline System

**Task:** Convert the markdown specifications into actual working Excel (.xlsx) files that customers can download and use immediately.

**Context:** This is a €99 digital product toolkit. Customers expect professional, working spreadsheets - not specifications they have to build themselves.

**Your Role:** Use the detailed specifications in this folder to create functional Excel files with formulas, data validation, conditional formatting, and professional appearance.

---

## REFERENCE FILES LOCATION

All specification files are in: `C:\Users\User\Documents\CY\ecosystems-united\tools\stack-1-products\audit-baseline-system-deliverables\`

Key specs to reference:
- `01-implementation-guide-outline.md` - Overall structure and workflow
- `02-energy-emissions-calculator-detailed-template.md` - Most detailed Excel spec
- `03-methodology-statement-template.md` - Documentation requirements
- `04-utility-data-collection-template.md` - Data collection workflow
- `00-TOOLKIT-CONTENTS-OVERVIEW.md` - Complete file list and requirements

---

## YOUR TASK

Build 23 working Excel (.xlsx) files following the specifications. Each file must be:
✅ Fully functional with working formulas
✅ Professionally formatted
✅ Protected (formulas locked, inputs unlocked)
✅ User-friendly with clear instructions
✅ Tested and ready for customer download

---

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Use Python with openpyxl library** to programmatically create Excel files.

**Why Python?**
- Repeatable and consistent formatting
- Easy to version control and update
- Can generate all 23 files systematically
- Ensures quality and reduces manual errors

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install openpyxl pandas xlsxwriter
```
