RESPONSE TEMPLATE LIBRARY
=========================

WHAT THESE TEMPLATES DO
-----------------------
These templates help you respond to buyer sustainability questions 
professionally and confidently—whether you have complete data or not.

Two situations require different approaches:

1. WHEN YOU HAVE DATA
   Use templates that present your information clearly, with proper
   context, methodology explanation, and supporting evidence.

2. WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE DATA (YET)
   Use templates that acknowledge gaps honestly while demonstrating
   commitment to improvement. Honesty builds more trust than weak
   estimates or evasion.

HOW TO USE THESE TEMPLATES
--------------------------

Step 1: Identify which situation you're in
   → Have data for this question? Use Section 2 templates
   → Don't have data (or only partial)? Use Section 3 templates

Step 2: Find the template that matches the question type
   → Carbon/emissions? Use Carbon Footprint template
   → Energy/water/waste? Use Metrics template
   → Certifications? Use Certifications template
   → General sustainability practices? Use appropriate template

Step 3: Customize the template
   → Replace [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS] with your information
   → Delete sections that don't apply
   → Adjust tone to match your buyer relationship
   → Review before sending

TEMPLATE CONVENTIONS
--------------------
[COMPANY NAME]         → Your company name
[OPERATION TYPE]       → Your operation type (farm, processor, etc.)
[SPECIFIC METRIC]      → The actual number/data
[TIME PERIOD]          → Year, quarter, or period covered
[METHODOLOGY]          → How you calculated/measured
[CUSTOMIZE HERE]       → Section requiring your input
[ALTERNATIVE: ...]     → Optional different phrasing

TONE GUIDANCE
-------------
• Professional but not stiff
• Transparent about limitations
• Confident without overpromising
• Forward-looking (improvement-oriented)
• Collaborative (partner, not vendor)

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
• These are starting points—customize to your voice
• Never claim data you don't have
• Honesty about gaps builds more trust than weak estimates
• Show improvement trajectory, not just current state
• Keep responses concise—buyers review many suppliers
```

### Template 3.3: Timeline Negotiation Response

**Use when:** You've received a request with an unrealistic deadline

**Template:**

```
TIMELINE NEGOTIATION RESPONSE
=============================

Subject: Re: [REQUEST] - Timeline Discussion

Dear [BUYER CONTACT],

Thank you for your sustainability data request dated [DATE]. We're 
committed to providing the information you need and want to discuss 
the timeline to ensure we deliver quality data.

REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT
----------------------
We understand you're requesting:
• [Summarize key data points requested]
• Deadline: [STATED DEADLINE]

OUR ASSESSMENT
--------------
After reviewing the request, we can provide:

IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE (within [X] days):
• [Data point 1]
• [Data point 2]

REQUIRES ADDITIONAL TIME:
• [Data point 3]: Requires [ACTION] - estimated [X] weeks
• [Data point 4]: Requires [ACTION] - estimated [X] weeks

[EXPLANATION - brief and professional:]
[Explain why time is needed without making excuses. Example:]
"Compiling verified Scope 1 emissions requires reconciling fuel records 
across [multiple sites/seasons], which we want to do accurately rather 
than provide estimates."

PROPOSED APPROACH
-----------------
We suggest the following timeline:

Phase 1 - [DATE] (by your deadline):
   Submit [data you CAN provide] plus improvement timeline for remainder

Phase 2 - [DATE] ([X] weeks after):
   Submit [additional data with more time]

Phase 3 - [DATE] ([X] weeks/months after):
   Submit complete data set as requested

[ALTERNATIVE:]
If your deadline is firm, we can provide [LIMITED SCOPE] by [DEADLINE] 
with the understanding that this represents [partial/estimated] data.

COMMITMENT
----------
We take your data needs seriously and want to provide accurate, 
defensible information. [Brief statement of commitment to relationship].

Can we schedule a brief call to align on the best approach?

Best regards,

### Template 3.4: Value Proposition Despite Gaps

**Use when:** Responding to comprehensive request where you have significant gaps but want to maintain relationship

**Template:**

```
VALUE PROPOSITION RESPONSE
==========================

Subject: Re: Sustainability Assessment - [COMPANY NAME]

Dear [BUYER CONTACT],

Thank you for including [COMPANY NAME] in your supplier sustainability 
assessment. While we have gaps in some areas you've inquired about, I 
want to share both our current capabilities and our commitment to 
improvement.

WHERE WE'RE STRONG
------------------
[Lead with positives - what you DO have]

✓ [STRENGTH 1]: [Brief description with data if available]
✓ [STRENGTH 2]: [Brief description with data if available]
✓ [STRENGTH 3]: [Brief description with data if available]

[Example strengths:]
• "Strong food safety record with [X] years zero recalls"
• "Certified [CERTIFICATION] since [YEAR]"
• "Water efficiency 20% better than regional benchmark"
• "Long-term employee retention demonstrating workforce satisfaction"

WHERE WE'RE BUILDING
--------------------
[Honest about gaps, but frame as active improvement]

We're actively developing capability in:
• [GAP 1]: [Current status and plan]
• [GAP 2]: [Current status and plan]

These gaps reflect [brief context - e.g., "our growth trajectory" or 
"emerging requirements in our sector"] rather than lack of commitment.

OUR IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY
--------------------------
[Show momentum and direction]

Recent improvements:
• [IMPROVEMENT 1]: [What changed, when, result]
• [IMPROVEMENT 2]: [What changed, when, result]

Planned improvements:

We'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how we can best support your 
sustainability goals while we build our capabilities.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
[COMPANY NAME]

## Section 4: Appendix - Good vs. Weak Response Examples

### Carbon Data Example

**WEAK RESPONSE:**
```
"We don't really track our carbon emissions. We're a small operation 
and don't have the resources for that kind of measurement. Most farms 
our size don't have this data. We could try to estimate something if 
you really need it."
```

**Problems:** Defensive, makes excuses, suggests unreliable estimates, no path forward

**STRONG RESPONSE:**
```
"We don't currently have verified carbon emissions data. We track fuel 
consumption and electricity use, which could form the basis for Scope 1 
and 2 calculations. We're planning to complete our first emissions 
inventory by Q3 using the GHG Protocol methodology. In the meantime, 
I can provide our fuel and energy consumption data if that would be 
helpful for your analysis."
```

**Why it works:** Honest, offers what's available, concrete plan, helpful orientation

---

### Missing Certification Example

**WEAK RESPONSE:**
```
"We're not certified because certifications are expensive and don't 
really prove anything about sustainability. We follow good practices 
even without the certificate."
```

**Problems:** Dismissive of buyer's priorities, defensive, no evidence

**STRONG RESPONSE:**
```
"We don't currently hold [CERTIFICATION], though we align our practices 
with the standard in several areas, including [SPECIFIC PRACTICE 1] and 
[SPECIFIC PRACTICE 2]. We're evaluating certification for 2025 and have 
completed a preliminary gap assessment. I'd be happy to share our 
self-assessment against the standard if that would be useful."
```

**Why it works:** Respects the question, shows alignment, concrete plan, offers alternative
