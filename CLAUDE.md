# Ecosystems United

## Project Overview
Ecosystems United is the main platform for the Five Stacks Framework, transforming sustainability compliance (CSRD) into competitive advantage for SMEs. Includes the public website, the EU web app, and the Five Stacks methodology.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js / TypeScript
- Supabase (if applicable â€” confirm)
- Tailwind CSS

## Current State
- Website and app in development
- Five Stacks Framework defined and being integrated
- CSRD toolkits and assessment flows in progress

## Architecture
- src/ â€” main application source
- public/ â€” static assets
- (update as project structure evolves)

## Git Conventions
- Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, chore:
- Keep subject lines under 72 characters
- Commit after each meaningful change, not at the end of a session
- Create feature branches for new work: feat/description

## Session Protocol
- At session start: read this file
- During work: commit every meaningful milestone
- At session end: update "Current State" above, commit, push
