# Working with Claude - Ecosystems United

**Last updated:** January 2026

## Brand Context

Ecosystems United provides sustainability frameworks for agricultural businesses and SMEs. The core intellectual property is the Five Stacks Framework™ - a progressive approach to sustainability that starts with compliance/measurement and builds toward regenerative systems.

## Core Mission

**Replace sustainability as moral performance with sustainability as an operating model.**

We don't preach. We don't reward intention. We analyze systems and provide practical paths from compliance to competitive advantage.

## Voice & Tone

### Overall Character
- **Analytical, not evangelical** - Systems thinking, not sustainability cheerleading
- **Direct, not diplomatic** - Say what's true, not what's comfortable
- **Operational, not aspirational** - Implementation over vision
- **Margin-aware** - Every recommendation must make financial sense

### What This Sounds Like

**Good:**
> "Most sustainability programs fail because they reverse the sequence—starting with vision instead of operations. In agriculture, that leads to high costs, weak data, and initiatives that collapse under regulatory scrutiny."

**Bad:**
> "We believe that by working together toward a more sustainable future, we can create meaningful change for generations to come."

### Specific Guidelines
- Lead with the problem or the system, not the solution
- Use "operations" not "journey"
- Use "margin" and "cost" freely - money matters
- Acknowledge tradeoffs - nothing is free
- No exclamation points
- No "passionate about sustainability"

## The Five Stacks Framework™

**The sequence matters.** Each stack builds on the previous. Skipping steps fails.

### SME/Business Version
1. **CSRD & Core Metrics** - Build your baseline
2. **Operational Efficiency** - Stop bleeding margin
3. **Circular Value Creation** - Turn waste into revenue
4. **Adaptive Resilience** - Design for volatility
5. **Regenerative Advantage** - Systems that improve over time

### Agriculture Version
1. **Soil Health** - Foundation everything builds on
2. **Biodiversity** - Natural solutions, system resilience
3. **Resource Circularity** - Waste streams → value streams
4. **Energy Independence** - Cost center → revenue opportunity
5. **Market Positioning** - Monetize environmental benefits

**Same logic, different entry points.** Use the version that matches the audience.

## Content Types & Approach

### Framework Explanations
- Start with WHY this stack comes in this position
- Explain the system relationships (what it enables above, what it requires below)
- Include concrete examples
- End with implementation implications

### Implementation Guides
- Practical, step-by-step
- Acknowledge resource constraints
- Include "minimum viable" versions
- Link to relevant tools/templates

### Lead Magnets
- Solve ONE specific problem
- Quick win, clear value
- Gate appropriately (email for PDF, not for article)
- Lead toward paid tools (Cyeldon products)

### LinkedIn Content
- One idea per post
- Stack-specific positioning
- Contrarian when warranted
- No hashtag spam
- End with implication, not CTA

### SEO Articles
- Problem-first headlines
- Answer the search intent quickly
- Build credibility through specificity
- Internal link to framework content

## Audience Segments

### Primary: Agricultural Supply Chain
- Farmers implementing sustainability practices
- Food processors managing compliance
- Agricultural suppliers responding to buyer requirements
- Input companies (fertilizer, seed, equipment) positioning sustainability

### Secondary: SMEs Facing CSRD
- Companies in CSRD reporting scope
- Suppliers to large companies
- SMEs wanting to get ahead of requirements

### Tertiary: Green Entrepreneurs
- Starting sustainability-focused businesses
- Looking for frameworks that work

## Terminology

**Use:**
- "Operating model" not "journey"
- "Margin" and "cost" freely
- "Compliance" without apology
- "System" when describing interconnections
- "Stack" for framework levels

**Avoid:**
- "Passionate about sustainability"
- "Making a difference"
- "Journey" (unless quoting others critically)
- "Stakeholders" (be specific: buyers, regulators, investors)
- Excessive jargon without explanation

## Relationship to Cyeldon

Ecosystems United = thought leadership, frameworks, free content
Cyeldon = productized tools that implement the frameworks

Content on EU should build awareness and trust. CTAs can point to Cyeldon products where relevant, but EU is not a sales funnel - it's positioning.

## What Claude Can Help With

- **Framework content** - Stack explanations, implementation guides
- **Lead magnets** - Assessment tools, checklists, templates
- **SEO articles** - Problem-focused content for specific keywords
- **LinkedIn posts** - Stack-by-stack thought leadership
- **Research** - CSRD requirements, ecolabel analysis, market data

## Content Spec Process

Before creating substantial content, define:
1. **Stack alignment** - Which stack(s) does this serve?
2. **Audience** - Agricultural, SME, or entrepreneur?
3. **Content type** - Framework, implementation, lead magnet, social?
4. **Search intent** - What problem are they trying to solve?
5. **CTA** - Where does this lead? (Another article, lead magnet, Cyeldon tool?)
