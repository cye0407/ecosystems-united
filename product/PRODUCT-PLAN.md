# Five Stacks System — Product Plan

**Created:** January 27, 2026  
**Status:** Active — supersedes previous PRODUCT-STRATEGY.md pricing

---

## Product Overview

**Name (working):** Five Stacks System  
**Platform:** Web application (mobile-friendly)  
**Entry point:** ecosystemsunited.com

**What it is:** A sequential operational system that builds sustainability capability through five progressive stacks. Each stack develops a specific competency. Together, they create adaptive capacity and compounding competitive advantage.

**What it is not:** A one-time assessment, a compliance checklist, or a template pack.

---

## Core Principles

### Sequential by Design

The stacks must be completed in order. Each creates the conditions for the next:

| Stack | Without it... |
|-------|---------------|
| 1 - Metrics | You can't find leaks you can't see |
| 2 - Efficiency | Circular systems on a leaky operation just leak faster |
| 3 - Circularity | Resilience without value capture is just cost |
| 4 - Resilience | Positioning claims without operational proof is greenwashing |

**Stack 1 is mandatory.** There is no entry point other than Stack 1.

### No Pressure to Continue

Users can stop at any stack. Stack 1 has standalone value (scope 3 data exports, compliance foundation). But they cannot skip ahead.

### Bundle = Full Access

Users who purchase the full bundle get access to all 5 stacks immediately. The UI makes the intended sequence clear, but there are no hard gates. They bought the whole system — they can explore as they choose.

## The Five Stacks

### Stack 1: Metrics (Visibility)

> Build your baseline. If you can't see it, you can't improve it.

**What users do:**
- Establish operational baseline (inputs, outputs, costs, flows)
- Map external landscape (market position, regulations, competitive dynamics)
- Document financial reality (budget, constraints, investment capacity)

**What users get:**
- Clear visibility into their operation
- Ability to answer sustainability questionnaires confidently
- Scope 3 data exports for customer requests
- Foundation for VSME/CSRD reporting
- Baseline metrics for everything that follows

**Standalone value:** Yes — even if a user never buys another stack, they have a functional compliance tool and data export capability.

---

### Stack 2: Efficiency (Margin)

> Stop the leaks. Fix what's broken before adding new initiatives.

**What users do:**
- Identify margin leaks (waste, overuse, redundancy, friction)
- Map external opportunities (what competitors are missing)
- Prioritize by ROI (where to start, what to fix first)

**What users get:**
- Documented efficiency improvements
- Cost reduction that funds further sustainability investment
- Evidence for financing applications and grant requirements
- Margin improvement visible to investors and lenders

---

### Stack 3: Circularity (Value Capture)

> Capture lost margin. Every output can be someone's input.

**What users do:**
- Map value leakage (waste streams, by-products, underused assets)
- Identify symbiosis opportunities (who needs what you're discarding)
- Calculate capture value (revenue potential vs. cost avoidance)

**What users get:**
- New revenue from former waste streams
- Reduced disposal costs
- Closed-loop credentials for tenders and partnerships
- Data for sustainability-linked financing

---

### Stack 4: Resilience (Stability)

> Design for volatility. Flex, don't just endure.

**What users do:**
- Map vulnerabilities (single points of failure, concentration risk)
- Track external shifts (trends, disruptions, emerging risks)
- Model scenarios (Plan A/B/C/D against real operational data)

**What users get:**
- Risk assessment for investor due diligence
- Supply chain resilience documentation
- Scenario planning capability
- Board-ready contingency plans
- Better insurance and lending terms

---

### Stack 5: Regeneration (Positioning)

> Compound advantage. Turn operational proof into market position.

**What users do:**
- Build positioning narrative (story, proof points, differentiation)
- Identify premium opportunities (where the market is heading)
- Calculate premium capture (pricing power, margin expansion)

**What users get:**
- Premium pricing backed by documented practices
- Certification readiness (B Corp, ecolabels, regenerative standards)
- Preferred supplier status with sustainability-conscious buyers
- Brand differentiation competitors can't fake
- Talent attraction

**Critical note:** Stack 5 only works if Stacks 1-4 are real. You can't position what you haven't built.

## Pricing Structure

### Per-Stack Pricing

| Product | SaaS (Annual) | Lifetime |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Stack 1 (Metrics) | €299/year | €699 |
| Stack 2 (Efficiency) | €249/year | €549 |
| Stack 3 (Circularity) | €249/year | €549 |
| Stack 4 (Resilience) | €249/year | €549 |
| Stack 5 (Regeneration) | €249/year | €549 |
| **All 5 (individual)** | **€1,295/year** | **€2,895** |

### Bundle Pricing

| Product | SaaS (Annual) | Lifetime |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Full System Bundle** | **€999/year** | **€1,999** |

**Bundle discount:** ~23% off individual stack pricing

## SaaS vs. Lifetime: The Honest Pitch

### SaaS (Annual Subscription)
- Lower upfront cost
- Flexibility to stop if circumstances change
- Ongoing access as long as subscription is active

### Lifetime (One-Time Purchase)
- Own the tool outright
- No recurring costs
- All future updates included — forever
- Higher upfront investment

**Why lifetime is priced as a premium:** Lifetime means lifetime. Users who choose this option are subsidizing their own long-term infrastructure cost. This is not a product that will change dramatically — so users are paying for permanence, not promises.

---

## Access Model

### Entry Requirements
- Stack 1 is the only entry point
- Users cannot purchase Stack 2+ without having Stack 1
- Users can import existing baseline data via guided process

### Progression
- Sequential unlock: Stack 2 requires Stack 1 complete, etc.
- Completion = demonstrated baseline, not perfection
- Users can work on adjacent stacks (e.g., building Stack 2 while finishing Stack 1 metrics)

### Bundle Access
- Full bundle = immediate access to all 5 stacks
- UI guides intended sequence
- No hard gates — users paid for the system, they decide how to use it
- Going out of sequence is "against intended use" but not prevented

---

## Target Buyer

### Primary: Mid-Market SMEs (50-500 employees)

**Who they are:**
- Operations managers told to "do something about sustainability"
- CFOs facing financing requirements for ESG credentials
- Founders who care personally and want to build it right
- Sustainability leads (if they have one) with budget authority

**Why €499-999 works:**
- Substantial enough to signal professional tool
- Not so expensive it requires procurement process
- Self-service purchase for anyone with budget authority
- Filters out non-serious buyers

### The Buyer Psychology

| Buyer | €299/year feels like... | €699 lifetime feels like... |
|-------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Founder/Owner | No-brainer expense | Smart investment |
| CFO | Reasonable tool cost | Capitalized asset |
| Sustainability Lead | Easy budget approval | Justifiable purchase |
| Ops Manager | Within discretionary spend | Needs approval but gettable |

## Positioning Summary

**For SMEs who need to build real sustainability capability:**

> "Five Stacks is an operational system, not a compliance checkbox. Start with your baseline. Stop the leaks. Capture lost margin. Build resilience. Then — and only then — position for premiums you've actually earned."

**The honest differentiator:** This isn't cheap templates. This isn't enterprise software you'll never use. This is a professional tool priced for businesses that are serious about building sustainability into how they operate.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Name:** "Five Stacks System" is working title. Final name TBD.
2. **Trial period:** 14-day free trial? Full functionality or limited?
3. **Upgrade credit:** If someone buys Stack 1, then later wants the bundle — credit toward purchase?
4. **Multi-site:** One account = one operation, or support for multiple sites?
