## Five Stacks Framework Definition

### Foundational Principle
Each stack builds organizational capability through deeper knowledge of YOUR specific operation. The framework scales - a 2-hectare farm and a 200-hectare operation both benefit.

**Content Strategy:**
- **Articles (free):** Valuable standalone insight at any level - anyone can read any stack and learn
- **Toolkits (paid):** Implementation infrastructure requiring foundational work

**Implementation Reality:**
- Reading level: Non-linear, explore what interests you
- Doing level: Sequential, each stack builds on the previous

---

### Stack 0: Where Are You Bleeding Value?
**Format:** Interactive diagnostic quiz
**Purpose:** Route visitors to the right stack based on their situation
**Lead Magnet:** Quiz itself (email capture)
**Paid Products:** None (routing mechanism)

---

### Stack 1: ESG & Core Metrics (Organizational Knowledge)
**Outcome:** Know your baseline + understand the external landscape

## Per-Stack Content Pattern

Each stack follows this pattern:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Landing page | Product showcase, "who it's for" |
| Lead magnet (free) | Email capture, value demonstration |
| 2+ paid packages | Revenue, implementation support |
| SEO articles | Trust building, organic traffic |
| Dedicated product pages | Deep dive on specific products (TBD) |
| Workshop/consulting | Guided implementation (emerging) |

---

## Legacy Content Strategy

The existing site has 60-80+ pages of legacy educational content (agribusiness, ecolabels, urban agriculture, energy/biofuels, intercropping, etc.).

### High-Value Legacy → Stack Mapping

| Legacy Topic | Stack Alignment | Action |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Ecolabels cluster (~9 pages) | Stack 1 | Add CTAs to Readiness Scorecard |
| Agribusiness cluster (~8 pages) | Stack 0 context | Soft CTAs to quiz |
| Intercropping/biodiversity (~5 pages) | Stack 4 | Reframe when toolkit ready |
| Energy/biofuels (~10 pages) | Stack 2-3 | LOW priority (wrong audience) |
| Food pyramid/nutrition | None | Ignore |

### Priority Actions

1. **Immediate:** Add CTAs to top ecolabel pages → free scorecard
2. **Short-term:** Consolidate duplicate URLs, add soft CTAs to agribusiness pages
3. **Future:** Create bridge articles linking legacy topics to stacks

---

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Agricultural SMEs (€5-15M revenue) facing supplier sustainability requirements

**Framework scales to:**
- Backyard/hobby farms optimizing operations
- Small commercial farms (5-50 hectares)
- Larger operations wanting systematic sustainability integration

**Positioning:** "The toolkit queen" - practical, affordable toolkits vs. expensive consulting
