## PHASE 2: Site Foundation (Jan 27 - Feb 3)

### Manifesto / Home Page Rewrite

**Current problem:** Site is ag-focused, needs cross-industry positioning

**New positioning:**
- "Sustainability that pays for itself"
- Framework applies to any operation facing sustainability pressure
- Agricultural examples but principles are universal
- "Toolkit queen" positioning: practical, affordable vs. expensive consulting

**Page structure:**
1. Hook: The sustainability trap (compliance theater vs. profit)
2. The Five Stacks Framework (brief visual overview)
3. Who this is for (with industry examples)
4. Start here: Stack 0 quiz or browse stacks
5. About Ecosystems United / Cat Yeldi

**Word count:** 800-1200 (punchy, not a manifesto essay)

### Stack 0: Diagnostic Quiz

**Purpose:** Route visitors to the right stack based on their situation

**Format:** 5-7 questions, branching logic

**Sample questions:**
1. Do you have 12+ months of baseline data for energy, water, and waste? (Y/N/Partial)
2. Have buyers or banks asked for sustainability data in the past 12 months? (Y/N/Expecting soon)
3. Can you identify your top 3 operational inefficiencies with data? (Y/N/Gut feel only)
4. Do you have revenue streams from waste/byproducts? (Y/N/Exploring)
5. How many distinct markets or products do you sell to/through? (1-2 / 3-5 / 6+)

**Routing logic:**
- No baseline data → Stack 1
- Has data but can't identify inefficiencies → Stack 2
- Knows inefficiencies but not monetizing → Stack 3
- Single market/product dependency → Stack 4
- Has options but struggles to navigate → Stack 5

**Tech:** Can be simple (Typeform/Tally embedded) or custom

---

## PHASE 3: Stack 2 Complete Build (Feb 3-10)

### Stack 2 Landing Page

**Outcome:** Move from passive data collection to informed operational changes

**Structure mirrors Stack 1:**
1. What this stack gives you
2. Why efficiency analysis matters (after you have baselines)
3. The three core questions Stack 2 answers (with article links)
4. Products section
5. Who needs Stack 2 / Who can skip it
6. What comes after Stack 2

### Stack 2 Articles

#### Article 1: The Margin Leak Audit
**Purpose:** Framework for finding where operations waste money
**The four leak categories:** Energy, Water, Materials/Waste, Labor/Process
**Word count:** 1800-2200

```
---
**What's YOUR energy efficiency ROI potential?**

## CTA Integration Pattern

### In-Article CTAs (Mid-content)

- Offers the tool that implements that concept
- "Get [Tool]" + "Or continue reading to understand X first"
- Formatted as a subtle box/divider, not aggressive

### End-of-Article CTAs
- Stronger, more detailed
- Lists what's included
- Offers related products for different situations
- Links to prerequisite or next stacks

### Landing Page CTAs
- Product showcase with full details
- Clear "who it's for" guidance
- Buy buttons
- Bundle upsells where relevant

## Open Decisions

1. **Stack 3-5 tools: Free or paid?**
   - Option A: Free lead magnets (simpler, faster)
   - Option B: Low-cost tools €29-49 (revenue, but more build time)
   - Option C: Mix (one free, rest paid)

2. **Stack 0 quiz tech:**
   - Typeform/Tally (fast, embedded)
   - Custom build (more control, more work)
   - Simple decision tree page (lowest tech)

3. **Stack 2 product pricing:**
   - €99 (matches Stack 1 baseline system)
   - €129 (reflects more analysis depth)
   - €149 (premium positioning)

4. **Cross-industry positioning depth:**
   - Light touch (agricultural examples, universal principles)
   - Heavy rewrite (multiple industry examples throughout)
   - Separate tracks later (ag version, food processing version, etc.)
