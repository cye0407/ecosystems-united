## 1. CONTENT TYPE

- [x] SEO article
- [x] Implementation guide

## 2. STACK ALIGNMENT

**Primary stack:** Stack 1 - ESG & Core Metrics

**Stack relationship:** This is the "how" article—after Article 1 explained what to measure, this explains how to actually build those baselines. Bridges to Article 3's "why now" urgency.

## 3. AUDIENCE

**Primary audience:**
- [x] Agricultural operators
- [x] SMEs facing CSRD (as suppliers)
- [x] Suppliers to large companies

**Audience state:** 
- Now knows WHAT to measure (from Article 1 or general awareness)
- Overwhelmed by the gap between "should measure" and "actually measuring"
- Worried about cost, time, complexity
- May think they need expensive consultants or software
- Doesn't realize they already have useful data scattered around

## 4. SEARCH INTENT

**What are they searching for?**
- "how to measure farm sustainability"
- "sustainability baseline measurement"
- "ESG data collection agriculture"
- "how to start sustainability reporting"

**Primary keyword:** sustainability baseline measurement

**Supporting keywords:** 
- agricultural sustainability data collection
- ESG baseline for farms
- sustainability reporting starting point
- audit-defensible sustainability data

**What problem are they trying to solve?**
"I know I need sustainability data but I don't know how to start collecting it without spending a fortune or hiring consultants."

## 5. CONTENT GOAL

Reader should finish knowing:
1. They already have more data than they think (utility bills, invoices, records)
2. The 90-day approach to minimum viable baselines
3. What "audit-defensible" actually means (documented methodology, not perfection)
4. How to fill gaps with staged solutions
5. They can do this themselves with the right structure

## 6. KEY MESSAGES

1. You're not starting from zero—you have scattered data that needs organizing
2. Defensible baselines require documented methodology, not perfect data
3. 90 days to minimum viable baseline; refinement happens over years
4. Start with what you have, fill gaps systematically

## 7. STRUCTURE OUTLINE

1. **Introduction:** The paralysis problem (knowing you should measure but not starting)
2. **You Already Have More Data Than You Think:** Utility bills, invoices, production records
3. **What "Audit-Defensible" Actually Means:** Methodology > perfection
4. **The 90-Day Baseline Approach:** Phased, practical timeline
5. **Filling Gaps Without Breaking the Bank:** Staged solutions (immediate/short/long-term)
6. **Documentation That Survives Scrutiny:** What auditors and buyers actually look for
7. **Common Baseline Failures:** What to avoid
8. **Conclusion / Next Steps**

## 8. CTA DESTINATION
