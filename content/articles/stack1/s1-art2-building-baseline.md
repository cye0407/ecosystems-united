# From Gut Feel to Data Defense: Building Your Operational Baseline

You know you need sustainability data. You probably even know what metrics matter—energy, water, waste, emissions, production output. But there's a gap between knowing you should measure something and actually having defensible numbers to report.

Most agricultural operations stall here. The task feels enormous. Where do you even start? Do you need consultants? Software? A full-time sustainability person?

Here's the reality: you already have more data than you think, scattered across utility bills, supplier invoices, and production records. The work isn't generating data from nothing—it's organizing what you have into metrics that survive scrutiny.

## You Already Have More Data Than You Think

Before you buy anything or hire anyone, look at what's already flowing through your operation.

**Utility bills tell you energy and water consumption.** Electricity bills show kWh. Gas bills show cubic meters or therms. Water bills show volume. This is measured data, not estimates—exactly what auditors want to see.

**Fuel invoices tell you diesel, petrol, and propane use.** Every fill-up receipt, fuel card statement, or supplier invoice documents consumption. Aggregate these by year and you have Scope 1 emission inputs.

**Supplier invoices tell you input volumes.** Fertilizer purchases, feed deliveries, seed orders, chemical applications—all documented on invoices you already have. These feed into Scope 3 calculations and input efficiency metrics.

**Production records tell you output.** Harvest weights, milk volumes, processing throughput, sales records—whatever you track for operational or financial purposes also serves as the denominator for intensity metrics.

**Waste hauler invoices tell you disposal volumes.** If you pay for waste collection, you have records of what left your operation and where it went.

**Financial records tie it together.** Your accounts show what you spent on energy, inputs, and waste disposal. Even if physical records are incomplete, financial records provide a cross-check.

The first step isn't measurement—it's inventory. What data do you already have? Where does it live? How far back does it go?

## What "Audit-Defensible" Actually Means

The phrase "audit-defensible" sounds intimidating. It's not.

Audit-defensible doesn't mean perfect data. It means documented methodology. Auditors and buyers don't expect you to have laboratory-grade precision. They expect you to show your work.

**Documented methodology means:**

You can explain where each number came from. "Diesel consumption is calculated from fuel card statements aggregated monthly" is defensible. "We estimated based on what felt right" is not.

You can show the source documents. Utility bills, invoices, meter readings, production logs—whatever generated the number should be retrievable.

You can explain your assumptions. If you estimated something, you documented how. "Irrigation water estimated at 650mm based on regional average for our crop type, adjusted for our irrigation system efficiency" is acceptable when measured data doesn't exist.

You can demonstrate consistency. You used the same methodology this year as last year, or you documented why it changed.

**What auditors actually look for:**

They're checking whether your numbers are plausible given your operation type. A 500-hectare grain farm claiming 10,000 liters of diesel consumption annually will get questions—that's impossibly low. They're checking whether source documents support your reported figures. They're checking whether your methodology makes sense for what you're measuring.

They're not expecting perfection. They're expecting honesty and documentation.

**The practical standard:**

If a skeptical buyer asked "how did you get this number?" could you answer clearly and produce supporting evidence? That's the bar for audit-defensible.

## The 90-Day Baseline Approach

You don't need a year to establish useful baselines. Ninety days of focused effort produces minimum viable baselines that satisfy initial buyer requests and give you something to improve from.

**Days 1-14: Inventory and Organize**

Gather existing data sources. Collect utility bills, fuel invoices, supplier records, production logs, waste documentation. Don't analyze yet—just locate and organize.

Create a simple tracking structure. Spreadsheets work fine. You need one place where consumption data gets recorded consistently, not scattered across email attachments and filing cabinets.

Identify obvious gaps. Which metrics have good data? Which have partial data? Which have nothing? This shapes where you focus effort.

**Days 15-45: Calculate Core Metrics**

Start with energy because it's the most commonly requested and you almost certainly have utility bills.

Calculate total energy consumption by source. Electricity in kWh. Fuel in liters. Gas in cubic meters. Convert to common units (megajoules or kWh equivalent) for total energy picture.

Calculate Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions using standard emission factors. Your electricity provider may publish their grid emission factor. Fuel emission factors are standardized and published by government agencies.

Add water and waste using the same approach—aggregate bills and records into annual totals.

Calculate intensity metrics by dividing environmental metrics by production output. Emissions per tonne of product. Energy per kilogram. Water per hectare.

**Days 46-75: Fill Critical Gaps**

For metrics where you have no data, implement simple tracking. A fuel log for vehicles without fuel cards. A meter reading schedule for unmetered water sources. A waste tracking sheet for streams without hauler invoices.

For metrics where you have partial data, fill gaps with documented estimates. Use conservative assumptions. Note the estimation methodology clearly.

Prioritize gaps that buyers are likely to ask about. Energy and emissions gaps are critical to close. Less commonly requested metrics can wait.

**Days 76-90: Document and Verify**

Write your methodology statement. For each metric, document: data sources used, calculation approach, emission factors applied, assumptions made, gaps and how they were addressed.

Cross-check numbers for plausibility. Does your energy consumption make sense for your operation size? Do year-over-year changes have explanations?

Compile your baseline report. Annual figures for each core metric, intensity calculations, methodology documentation, known limitations and improvement plans.

**What you have after 90 days:**

Defensible baseline figures for core metrics. Documented methodology you can show to buyers or auditors. A system for ongoing data collection. Clear understanding of where to improve data quality.

This isn't the end—it's the foundation. Year two refines quality. Year three, your systems run routinely with high-quality data. But after 90 days, you can answer buyer questions with real numbers.

## Filling Gaps Without Breaking the Bank

Not every data gap requires expensive solutions. Match the solution to the gap's importance and your resources.

**Immediate solutions (this week, minimal cost):**

Manual logs for consumption without automatic records. A notebook tracking fuel additions, water meter readings, waste bins filled. Low-tech but effective.

Estimation with documentation for historical periods. You can't go back and measure last year's water use, but you can estimate based on this year's measured data, cropping patterns, and weather differences.

Supplier requests for missing information. Your electricity provider can often supply historical consumption data. Fuel suppliers have delivery records. Waste haulers have pickup records. Ask before assuming you need to reconstruct.

**Short-term solutions (next quarter, modest investment):**

Sub-metering for high-consumption areas. If one facility dominates electricity use but you want to understand the breakdown, a few sub-meters provide granular data.

Fuel management systems for vehicle fleets. Fuel cards or tank monitoring systems capture consumption data automatically with vehicle attribution.

Digital record-keeping replacing paper. Moving from paper logs to simple digital forms reduces transcription errors and makes aggregation easier.

**Long-term solutions (next year, significant investment):**

Automated data capture integrated with operational systems. Energy management systems, precision agriculture platforms, and processing line instrumentation that capture environmental data as a byproduct of operational management.

Sustainability software platforms that aggregate data from multiple sources, calculate metrics automatically, and generate reports. Worth it when manual processes become unwieldy.

External verification and assurance. Third-party audits that validate your data quality and methodology—increasingly required by major buyers and regulations.

**The principle:**

Start with what you can do immediately. Add capability as gaps prove material and resources allow. Don't wait for perfect systems to start measuring.

## Documentation That Survives Scrutiny

The difference between defensible and questionable baselines is documentation. Same numbers, different outcomes based on whether you can show your work.

**For every metric, document:**

**Data source.** "Electricity consumption from monthly utility bills, account #12345, supplier XYZ Energy."

**Calculation method.** "Total annual consumption calculated by summing 12 monthly statements. Emissions calculated using grid emission factor of 0.42 kg CO2e/kWh from national inventory 2024."

**Time period.** "Calendar year 2024, January 1 through December 31."

**Boundary.** "Includes main production facility and cold storage building. Excludes residential farmhouse on separate meter."

**Assumptions and estimates.** "Diesel consumption for March estimated at 2,400 liters based on average of February and April due to missing fuel card statement. Represents approximately 8% of annual diesel consumption."

**Known limitations.** "Water consumption excludes rainwater harvesting system, estimated at 15% of total irrigation water. Metering to be installed Q2 2025."

**This documentation serves multiple purposes:**

Buyers reviewing your data can understand exactly what you're reporting. Auditors verifying your claims can trace numbers to sources. You can replicate the calculation next year consistently. Anyone taking over this work understands the methodology.

**Keep source documents accessible.** Utility bills, invoices, meter reading logs, calculation spreadsheets—organized where you can retrieve them if asked. Digital copies work fine. The point is retrievability, not format.

## Common Baseline Failures (And How to Avoid Them)

**Starting too broad.** Trying to measure everything at once produces low-quality data across many metrics instead of solid data on the important ones. Start with energy and emissions. Add water, waste, and production intensity. Expand from there.

**Perfectionism paralysis.** Waiting for perfect data systems before reporting anything. You'll never have perfect data. Start with what you have, document limitations, improve over time. A documented baseline with acknowledged gaps beats no baseline.

**Undocumented estimates.** Estimates are necessary and acceptable when measured data doesn't exist. Undocumented estimates are not. If you estimated, write down how. If you can't remember how you got a number, it's not defensible.

**Inconsistent boundaries.** Reporting electricity for three facilities one year and five the next without restating prior figures or explaining the change. Define your boundary clearly and maintain consistency—or document changes explicitly.

**Missing the operational value.** Treating baseline building as pure compliance work rather than operational intelligence. The same data that satisfies buyer requests reveals efficiency opportunities. Use it for both.

**Ignoring plausibility checks.** Reporting numbers that don't make sense for your operation type. If your calculated emissions are 90% lower than industry average, something's probably wrong with your calculation—not your efficiency. Cross-check against benchmarks.

## Where This Leads

A solid baseline is the foundation for everything else in sustainability management.

With baselines, you can set credible improvement targets. "Reduce energy intensity by 15% over three years" only makes sense if you know your starting point.

With baselines, you can identify operational inefficiencies. The same data that satisfies buyer requests reveals where you waste energy, water, and materials. That's Stack 2 territory—using baseline data to find margin leaks.

With baselines, you can respond confidently to buyer requests. Instead of scrambling when questionnaires arrive, you pull documented figures from your system.

Article 3, *Surviving Buyer ESG Scrutiny*, explains what's driving the urgency around these requests and how to assess your exposure timeline.
