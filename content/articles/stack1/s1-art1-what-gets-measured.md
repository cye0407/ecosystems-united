# What Actually Gets Measured in Agricultural Sustainability (And Why It Matters)

You've been told you need "sustainability data." Maybe a buyer sent a questionnaire. Maybe your bank mentioned ESG requirements. Maybe you've seen the headlines about CSRD and supply chain reporting.

But when you sit down to actually do something about it, the first question is obvious: what am I supposed to measure?

The answer isn't as complicated as the sustainability industry makes it seem. A core set of metrics covers most requirements—buyer questionnaires, certification standards, bank requests, and your own operational intelligence. Get these right, and you've handled 80% of what anyone will ask for.

## The Overlap That Works in Your Favor

Different stakeholders want different things. Buyers need supplier emissions for their Scope 3 reporting. Banks want ESG metrics for lending decisions. Certifications have specific checklists. You want to know where your operation wastes money.

Here's the good news: substantial overlap exists between all of these. The metrics that buyers need are often the same ones that reveal operational inefficiencies. The data banks want is the data that helps you make better decisions.

This means you're not building multiple measurement systems. You're building one system that serves multiple purposes.

## The Core Metrics That Matter

For most agricultural operations, five to seven metrics cover the vast majority of requirements. These aren't arbitrary—they're the data points that appear consistently across buyer questionnaires, certification standards, and regulatory frameworks.

### 1. Energy Consumption and Emissions

This is the metric everyone asks about first. Your energy use—electricity, diesel, natural gas, propane—drives your Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions calculations.

**What to track:**
- Electricity consumption (kWh) by source if possible
- Fuel consumption by type (liters or gallons of diesel, gasoline, propane, natural gas)
- Any renewable energy generation or purchases

**Why it matters beyond compliance:**
Energy is usually your largest controllable cost after labor and inputs. Tracking consumption reveals patterns—seasonal spikes, equipment inefficiencies, process waste. Operations that measure energy use typically find 10-20% reduction opportunities within the first year.

**What buyers actually ask:**
"What are your Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions?" They want a number in tonnes CO2e. To give them that number, you need energy consumption data plus the right emission factors. The calculation itself isn't hard—the hard part is having accurate consumption data.

### 2. Water Use

Water metrics matter more in some regions than others, but they appear on nearly every sustainability questionnaire regardless of location.

**What to track:**
- Total water withdrawal by source (municipal, groundwater, surface water, rainwater)
- Water consumption vs. discharge (what comes in, what goes out)
- Irrigation volumes if applicable

**Why it matters beyond compliance:**
Water costs money. In water-stressed regions, it may become your operational constraint. Even in water-abundant areas, pumping and treatment have energy costs. Tracking water use often reveals leaks, inefficient irrigation, and process improvements.

**What buyers actually ask:**
"What is your water consumption per unit of output?" or "Do you operate in water-stressed areas?" The first requires measurement. The second requires knowing your location's water risk—which you can check using free tools like WRI Aqueduct.

### 3. Waste Generation

Waste metrics capture what leaves your operation that isn't product—everything from packaging to processing residues to end-of-life materials.

**What to track:**
- Waste volumes by type (organic, recyclable, hazardous, landfill)
- Waste destinations (recycled, composted, landfill, incineration)
- Any waste-to-value streams (byproducts sold, compost produced)

**Why it matters beyond compliance:**
Waste is cost made visible. Every kilogram of waste was once something you paid for—inputs, packaging, materials. Tracking waste streams often reveals opportunities: byproducts that have market value, recyclables generating rebates, process changes that reduce waste at the source.

**What buyers actually ask:**
"What percentage of your waste is diverted from landfill?" or "Do you have circular economy initiatives?" Having waste data lets you answer with specifics instead of vague claims.

### 4. Land Use and Biodiversity Indicators

For agricultural operations, land use metrics connect your production to environmental outcomes—soil health, habitat, ecosystem services.

**What to track:**
- Total land area under management
- Land use types (cropland, pasture, forest, wetland, buildings)
- Any conservation or set-aside areas
- Soil health indicators if available (organic matter, soil tests)
- Biodiversity practices (hedgerows, buffer strips, cover crops)

**Why it matters beyond compliance:**
Land is your productive asset. Soil health determines long-term productivity. Biodiversity practices often correlate with pest management benefits and reduced input costs. These metrics also position you for emerging ecosystem service markets—carbon credits, biodiversity credits, conservation payments.

**What buyers actually ask:**
"What percentage of your land is under sustainable management practices?" or "Do you have deforestation-free sourcing?" Having land use data lets you document what you're actually doing.

### 5. Production Output

Production metrics seem obvious, but they're essential for calculating intensity ratios—emissions per kilogram of product, water per tonne of output.

**What to track:**
- Total production volumes by product type
- Yields per hectare or per animal
- Input-to-output ratios where relevant

**Why it matters beyond compliance:**
Intensity metrics are how buyers compare suppliers. Absolute emissions matter, but emissions per unit of product tell the real efficiency story. A large operation with high absolute emissions but low intensity may be more sustainable than a small operation with poor efficiency.

**What buyers actually ask:**
"What are your emissions per kilogram of product?" You can only answer this if you track both emissions AND production output.

### 6. Input Tracking (Often Overlooked)

Inputs—fertilizers, pesticides, feed, seed, purchased materials—drive both costs and environmental impacts.

**What to track:**
- Fertilizer use by type and volume
- Pesticide and herbicide applications
- Feed purchases and sources
- Seed and planting material
- Packaging and other purchased materials

**Why it matters beyond compliance:**
Inputs are your largest variable cost. Tracking them precisely reveals over-application, waste, and optimization opportunities. Input data also feeds into more sophisticated analyses—nitrogen balances, pesticide load calculations, supply chain traceability.

**What buyers actually ask:**
"What are your Scope 3 upstream emissions?" or "Do you track fertilizer use efficiency?" Input tracking is essential for answering both.

## What "Good" Looks Like: Benchmark Ranges

Knowing what to measure is step one. Knowing whether your numbers are competitive is step two.

Benchmark data varies significantly by operation type, region, and production system. These ranges give you a starting reference point—your specific context may differ.

**Energy intensity (crop production):**
- Efficient operations: 0.5-2.0 MJ per kg product
- Average operations: 2.0-5.0 MJ per kg product
- High-energy operations: 5.0+ MJ per kg product

**Water intensity (varies dramatically by crop):**
- Low water crops: 500-1,000 liters per kg
- Moderate water crops: 1,000-3,000 liters per kg
- High water crops: 3,000-10,000+ liters per kg

**Waste diversion rates:**
- Leading operations: 80%+ diverted from landfill
- Good operations: 50-80% diverted
- Typical operations: 20-50% diverted

**GHG emissions intensity (highly variable):**
- Field crops: 0.2-1.0 kg CO2e per kg product
- Vegetables: 0.5-2.0 kg CO2e per kg product
- Livestock: 2.0-30+ kg CO2e per kg product (species-dependent)

These benchmarks come from various industry sources and academic studies. Your buyers may have their own benchmark expectations based on their supply chain analysis. When in doubt, ask what they consider "good performance" for your product category.

## Prioritization: Where to Start

You don't need all metrics on day one. Prioritize based on your situation:

**If buyers are already asking questions:**
Start with whatever they're asking about. Review their questionnaire or scorecard. Most buyer requests focus heavily on energy/emissions and increasingly on water. Get those two right first.

**If you're preparing before requests arrive:**
Start with energy, because it's the most commonly requested metric and has the clearest operational value. Add water if you're in a water-stressed region or water-intensive production. Add waste if you have significant waste streams.

**If you're optimizing operations (not just compliance):**
Start with whatever costs you the most money. Usually that's energy or inputs. Measurement reveals patterns; patterns reveal opportunities.

**If you're pursuing certification:**
Check the certification requirements. Different standards emphasize different metrics. Organic cares about inputs and practices. Regenerative certifications care about soil and biodiversity. Climate labels care about emissions.

## Common Mistakes That Waste Time

**Measuring everything at once.** Sustainability measurement can expand infinitely. Start with the core metrics that serve your immediate needs. Add sophistication over time.

**Estimating when you could measure.** Estimates are necessary for gaps, but measured data is always more defensible. If you have utility bills, invoices, and production records, use them. Don't estimate what you can document.

**Perfect data before any data.** Auditors and buyers don't expect perfection in year one. They expect documented methodology, honest gap acknowledgment, and systematic improvement. Start measuring now with the data you have.

**Ignoring production output.** Absolute metrics without intensity ratios tell an incomplete story. Always track production volumes alongside environmental metrics.

**Choosing metrics based on what's easy.** Measure what matters, not just what's convenient. If energy is your biggest cost and impact but you have poor energy data, fix the data gap rather than focusing on less important metrics you already track.

**Not documenting methodology.** How you measured matters as much as what you measured. Different calculation methods produce different numbers. Document your approach so you can defend it and ensure consistency over time.
